<PRE>Hi,
   First post here. My long term Gentoo machine smoked itself this
week after 5 years of hard work for me. I'm looking for thoughts on
which drive manufacturers generally cause the fewest compatibility
problems with cdrtools. I've had some (not a lot) problems with
Lite-On in previous machines. I've had good luck with a Matshusta in a
PPC Apple box. Other than that not much specific manufacturer
experience so no way to choose well.

   Typical brands I think I remember seeing at Frys are Lite-on, Sony
and Plextor, along with a few HP's which are typically more expensive.

    The new motherboard is in the mail but only has SATA ports so I
need to go buy a new internal drive at Fry's today or tomorrow. I
spent time looking at the compatibility list at the cdrtools web site
but was unable to find any of the model numbers for sale at NewEgg so
I'm shooting in the dark a bit without some guidance.

   I need the drive primarily for playing DVD movies, writing DVD
backups once in awhile, and writing CD copies using cdda2wav/cdrecord.

   I understand this market changes a lot so any guidance is pretty
much just a guess but I figure there must be a lot of good ideas here.
(I hope!)

Thanks,
Mark
