  J&#246;rg,


I don't like that aspect either. I do hope they eventually release
the source. However, it sure beats booting to Windows to update and
does not &quot;ask any questions&quot; - for example, it does not refuse to
downgrade firmware. 

Do you know a truly open solution and which drives does that apply
to?

Also, thank you for the drive info. That is some really good stuff
to know.

BTW, for the record, the *worst* drive I ever owned was by a company
called Optorite (not to be confused with Optiarc which I like). It
was cheap and came with a free T-shirt. I don't think Optorite is
still in business. Worst crap I ever saw. I gave the drive away for
free, warning the friend of mine not to take it but he could not
resist free stuff. He used it for awhile and it nearly drove him
mad, so close yet the burns were just not reliable enough. He
eventually ditched it. I can't even wear the t-shirt either - 
anyone advertising that will look like an idiot.



  Cheers,

  Mike
