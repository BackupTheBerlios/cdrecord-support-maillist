I can't speak for cdrtools, but I do have some experience with
which drives are better under Linux, but as you said the market
changes, and I haven't bought one in awhile either.

A good site to look for opinions is:

www.cdfreaks.com

Which seems to be renamed myce.com now. Anyway, the CD/DVD forums
are here:

<A HREF="http://club.myce.com/f61/">http://club.myce.com/f61/</A>

The the general consensus that I see is that drives made by LG,
NEC (now Optiarc/Sony) and Samsung are favored by those in the know.

I personally like the binflash linux command line firmware update
utility for the NEC/Optiarc series:

<A HREF="http://binflash.cdfreaks.com/">http://binflash.cdfreaks.com/</A>

and the hopped up Liggy and Dee's NEC/Optiarc firmware:

<A HREF="http://liggydee.cdfreaks.com/page/en/">http://liggydee.cdfreaks.com/page/en/</A>

(Be sure and writeout/save your original firmware before any upgrades
in case you ever want to go back.) If I were buying a SATA DVD burner
today, I'd take a good look at the Optiarc AD-7240S:

<A HREF="http://www.myce.com/review/optiarc-ad-7240s-dvd-burner-review-15981/">http://www.myce.com/review/optiarc-ad-7240s-dvd-burner-review-15981/</A>

which is available for only $26 at Newegg:

<A HREF="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16827118030">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16827118030</A>

or the corresponding AD-7241S or AD-7243S for those who need Lightscribe
or Labelflash capability (which really ain't worth it).

Lack of bitsetting (ability to set DVD+R/+RW media to identify itself as
a DVD-ROM for maximum DVD player compatibility) is not really a negative
because the Liggy and Dee firmware does have this feature.

According to one Newegg reviewer, the 7240S has a real NEC chipset and
one that runs without creating much heat.


  Cheers,

  Mike Shell
