Mike,
   Thanks for all the great info. Very helpful. I stopped in a Fry's
today. On the shelves they had Lite-On, LG, Plextor (more expensive),
some HP and something called Gear Heads. I'll have to see if I can
find more info on that.

   All that said at $26 the OptiArc you suggested looks good. It's got
the right features and if I order it tonight and get lucky maybe it
will get stuffed into the box with the rest of my NewEgg order and
arrive at the same time. That would be nice. As it has 539 reviews
with 85% either 4 or 5 stars it's hard to imagine it's a bad drive.

   I don't think the bit setting feature is all that important to me
right now, but it might become more so over time. I had no idea there
was (I guess...) Open Source (or at least free like beer) firmware out
there. The Liggy and Dee stuff looks quite interesting and being that
I could flash from Linux would be really great. A couple of times I've
burned copies of instructional videos for my wife to watch in the
living room buy more of them were coming dual-layer which I couldn't
write so I haven't done that in a while. As this drive seems to
support dual-layer maybe that would be important.

   Again, I really appreciate all the info and ideas.

Cheers,
Mark
