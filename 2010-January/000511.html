</I>&gt;<i> experience so no way to choose well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    Typical brands I think I remember seeing at Frys are Lite-on, Sony
</I>&gt;<i> and Plextor, along with a few HP's which are typically more expensive.
</I>
Plextor does no longer make drives and HP did never make drives.
Many companies did stop making drives during the past 5 years as production 
costs in Japan are high while the win on a single drive is less than 2 US $.
In general most companies did form alliances with companies that have 
production plants in either Korera or Malaysia. A single company (LiteON)
seems to be located in China.

The following companies remain:

NEC/Sony/Optiarc	Manufactured by Mitsumi
Pioneer/TEAC   		(here is where I con't know the exact relations)
Hitachi/LG (HL-DT-ST)	Manufactured by LG
Toshiba/Samsung (TSST)	Manufactured by Samsung
Matsduschda		(english transcription Matsushita) No information on relations
LiteON			May also manufacture for Optiarc

Based on recent firmware bugs, it seems that Plextor currently sells
Pioneer drives. Maybe, Pioneer no buys motors from &quot;Shinano Kenshi&quot; ;-)

&gt;<i>     The new motherboard is in the mail but only has SATA ports so I
</I>&gt;<i> need to go buy a new internal drive at Fry's today or tomorrow. I
</I>&gt;<i> spent time looking at the compatibility list at the cdrtools web site
</I>&gt;<i> but was unable to find any of the model numbers for sale at NewEgg so
</I>&gt;<i> I'm shooting in the dark a bit without some guidance.
</I>
You may be interested on whether your OS implements correctly working 
ATAPI on SATA support.

&gt;<i>    I need the drive primarily for playing DVD movies, writing DVD
</I>&gt;<i> backups once in awhile, and writing CD copies using cdda2wav/cdrecord.
</I>
The market seems to be completely reordered since ~ 2 years.

The usability of a drive for a specific case mainly depends on the firmware.
Firmware producers seem to be:

NEC		Good overall behavior
		Does not read hidden track on &quot;13&quot; &quot;Die &#196;rzte&quot;
		Writes partially wrong TOC for audio CDs if not using RAW mode
		Shows wrong max DVD write speed
Pioneer		Best ability to write low quality DVD media
		Writes CDs with more than &quot;Index 00 + Index 01&quot; only on RAW mode
		due to a silly internal drive memory layout design.
		Shows wrong max DVD write speed
Hitachi		I have neither good nor bad information for this one
Toshiba		I currently have no related writer
Matsduschda	I only own a BluRay from them and it seemd to be OK otherwise
LiteON		Writes CDs with backwards counting time code if not in RAW mode

Note that (unlile in earlier times) I don't own drives from all companies.
I cannot tell whether there are other problems with any of the companies than the 
ones I mentioned above.
