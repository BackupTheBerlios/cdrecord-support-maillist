Well, princo is a _very_ cheap manufacturer. The problem with your error 
message is, that it is only known by &quot;Toshiba/Samsung&quot; as it is vendor specific.
So I have no idea what it means. So this error message could also mean &quot;cannot 
write this media for some reason&quot;. Please try with Verbatin Media. Note that 
Verbatim puts better quality in retail packages with less disks inside than in 
50s spindles....these spindles may have been made by Moser Baer India.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Cdrecord-ProDVD-ProBD-Clone   isnt it time we changed that now to

The clone feature (which is in readcd and cdrecord) has been added 12 years ago 
to permit to create copies of CDs with unknown and complex structure, such as 
game CDs. To be more specific: at that time, I tried to copy a video CD using 
&quot;cdrdao&quot; that claimed to be able to maked copies from video CDs. As it turned 
out that this was just a marketing gag, I needed to implement something in 
cdrtools that was able to make copies from Video CDs and this is what the clone
feature was made for.

The official cdrecord was indeed limited by not having source for DVD support 
for some time, but this was a result of a NDA with Pioneer that prevented me 
from making things OSS as long as those things were not widely known - e.g. 
until even companies like Nero did learn how to write DVDs without my help ;-)

So in theory, I could have made the DVD stuff OSS a year earlier than I 
actually did. The reason for this delay was that some people tried to blackmail 
me and I was not willing to let things look as if they have been successful.

Anyway, the missing (in the OSS) feature was freely available for everyone via 
precompiled binaries.
