I did have that thought, must have something to do with SATA side of
things since the old IDE never had the problem, I note  3.7.9 was
released overnight so I might put that on tonight and see how we go.

There was one successful burn prior, every attempt after that gives that
result.

Manufacturer:   'PRINCO'

Maybe this drive can only partially handle those disks. For emergency
reasons I still keep the original slackware large kernel on installs
even though I always use custom kernel, its 2.6.33.4, I might try
booting into that kernel and seeing if it makes a difference, also, I
think 3.8 is getting close to official release so I might try the latest
rc as well, the fact cdrecord sees and burns at least one, leads me to
agree with you that its kernel related, if it was cdrecord at fault
surely it just would not even burn the first one.



&gt;<i> cdrecord -minfo

</I>&gt;<i> before writing to get the apparen media state before starting to write.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; PS:

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Cdrecord-ProDVD-ProBD  :)

</I>&gt;<i> Do you belive that cdrecord is no longer capable of doing clone writes?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>

Ahh, might be the grey matter, but I thought the Clone came about well
over ten years back when there was a different version, a  Clone patch,
from when official cdrecord was limited with DVD (I think it was) , way
tooooooo long back to remember, once you changed that method/policy, I
returned to your official source, but yeah it was great many years ago,
you likely remember that more than me :) I (wrongfully) assumed the name
stayed, or maybe i'm still muddled up - sign of getting too old.

Will let you know how it goes

Take care
Noel
