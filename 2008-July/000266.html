Well, you did replace ; by &amp;&amp; only at a place whete the left side would never 
fail. Your change is obviously not related to the problem I describe. There may 
be another bash bug in your case.


&gt;<i> &gt; You should really rethink whether you continue to use gmake.

</I>&gt;<i> It's actually a completely different paradigm: modeling the package's

</I>&gt;<i> Not an Ultime Solution (tm), but fine for simply structured packages.
</I>
Reading this, I understand that you don't know David Korn ;-)

First, you should read this: 

<A HREF="ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/smake/PortableSoftware.ps.gz">ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/smake/PortableSoftware.ps.gz</A>

It explains how highly portable software may be build.


When I first saw imake 20 years ago, I understood that this is the wrong way 
and just a big machine to wast CPU cycles.

Later, the FSF started with autoconf which usually does two jobs:

-	create a include file with config data that contain results from
	fine grained platform tests. This is an implemtation of the ideas
	of the pioneers of the openSource movement Larry Wall and Rich $alz
	from around 1980.

-	create modified makefiles. This is not a good idea.

This is why I only use the first part from autoconf. BTW: stay with the working
old portable autoconf as the new autoconf is based on the existence of bash.

David Korn in 1991 decided to believe that he needs a &quot;make&quot; replacement
and wrote &quot;nmake&quot;. I (together with a friend) found in 1992 that any halfway 
modern make supports &quot;include&quot; and allows to write object oriented make rules
in case a portable solution to implement if/then/else was found.

The result is funny: David Korn's &quot;leaf nmakefiles&quot; look _very_ similar to my 
makefiles. They are just a table that lists the source files and the options.
The rest is done by the build system.

I believe that your idea of using xml for this task is &quot;inhumane&quot; ;-)

BTW: bootstrapping my build system is simple as any even brain dead &quot;make&quot; 
could build the bootstrap-smake and as there is even a way to compile the first
stage of smake using portable shell scripts. How do you port your software to a 
new unknown platform?


&gt;<i> &gt; Gmake still did not fix a bug that I reported in 1997 although it has been 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> URL ?
</I>
There was a mail exchange 11 years ago. I know of no URLs, you may search for 
it.

GNU make has a design bug. It does not follow the rule &quot;try to 'make' anything
before you try to use it&quot;. gmake does this for top the level &quot;makefile&quot; but not
for included make files. As a result gmake prints error messages that should 
never appear. In this area gmake is a piece of junk. It tries to hide this bug 
with the following strategy:

-	start gmake and continue on failed include statements _although_ the 
	files are missing.

-	execute rules including the ones to create the include files

-	restart (re-exec) gmake with the saved args

I did even allow the gmake authors to use the correct algorithm from smake, so 
it would not be hard to fix the bug.

3 years ago, I reported a bug in the way gmake examines it's environment. This 
causes gmake to dump core under certain conditions. This bug could be fixed 
with a 2 line change that I send. The bug is still present in recent gname 
releases. I consider gmake to be an &quot;unmaintained program&quot; for this reason.

&gt;<i> &gt; accepted to be a bug by the gmake &quot;crew&quot;. Gmake in addition does not work 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; correctly on several &quot;DOS like&quot; platforms like e.g. Win-32. This is because 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the makefile parser from gmake does not correctly handle white space and the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; quote character '\\'.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yep, the tab/whitespace issue is an ugly thing. Back when I was learning
</I>&gt;<i> (g)make, it caused me some headache ;-o
</I>
There is no way to work around this gmake bug unless you like to make the 
makefile to fail on correct make implementations.

Rule of thumb: better try to fix the defective program instead of trying to 
work around the bugs.
