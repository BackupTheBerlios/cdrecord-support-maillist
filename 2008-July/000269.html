&gt;<i> &gt; Already did. But at that point I did a bit research with a completely

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It's actually a completely different paradigm: modeling the package's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; structure instead of build rules (model- instead of process-driven).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Not an Ultime Solution (tm), but fine for simply structured packages.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Reading this, I understand that you don't know David Korn ;-)
</I>
Besides I know and had several talks about ksh w/ him, what does David
have to do with my buildsystem ?
 
&gt;<i> First, you should read this: 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/smake/PortableSoftware.ps.gz">ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/smake/PortableSoftware.ps.gz</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It explains how highly portable software may be build.
</I>
It explains *your* view. On a first look it seems quite fine, but I 
already mentioned that you buildsystem isn't without problems.
 
&gt;<i> Later, the FSF started with autoconf which usually does two jobs:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> -	create a include file with config data that contain results from
</I>&gt;<i> 	fine grained platform tests. This is an implemtation of the ideas
</I>&gt;<i> 	of the pioneers of the openSource movement Larry Wall and Rich $alz
</I>&gt;<i> 	from around 1980.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> -	create modified makefiles. This is not a good idea.
</I>
In general: ack.

But: the whole autotools stuff is anything but robust. You need to be
very careful. Your paper already mentions several problems.

&gt;<i> I believe that your idea of using xml for this task is &quot;inhumane&quot; ;-)
</I>
If you just don't like xml, you could also use any other way for storing
hierachies, bracked expressions (lisp), C-struct style, filesystem, 
whatever you like.

The major idea behind is that you have an hierachy of classified objects.
One object type, for example, is a library node. It consists of things 
like source nodes (eg. .c), header nodes (which might be either public
or private - that affects installing) or import nodes (import other libs). 
Then it's up to the buildsystem only (!) how to pull things together.
As the application developer, these details are completely out of your
scope, intentionally.

For lot's of packages this is approach is fine, for others not. Well,
you've got the choice :P

&gt;<i> BTW: bootstrapping my build system is simple as any even brain dead &quot;make&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> could build the bootstrap-smake and as there is even a way to compile the first
</I>&gt;<i> stage of smake using portable shell scripts. 
</I>
I absolutely dislike the idea of some package bringing its own make tool,
this causes a lot of headache, at least w/ crosscompiling.
Instead just clearly state which tools are required and leave that job
to the user.

&gt;<i> How do you port your software to a new unknown platform?
</I>
Port the buildsystem to that platform and then just use it.
In the treebuild model, there are no platform specifics visible to 
the application (besides some symbols which might be set or not).
For example, there is exactly one way to declare the structure of 
certain package. Note: you just give the structure, the actual build
process is out of scope then.

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Gmake still did not fix a bug that I reported in 1997 although it has been 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; URL ?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There was a mail exchange 11 years ago. I know of no URLs, you may search for 
</I>&gt;<i> it.
</I>
Could you please bounce these mails to me ?

&gt;<i> GNU make has a design bug. It does not follow the rule &quot;try to 'make' anything
</I>&gt;<i> before you try to use it&quot;. gmake does this for top the level &quot;makefile&quot; but not
</I>&gt;<i> for included make files. As a result gmake prints error messages that should 
</I>&gt;<i> never appear.
</I>
Could you please give an detailed example ?

&gt;<i> In this area gmake is a piece of junk. It tries to hide this bug 
</I>&gt;<i> with the following strategy:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> -	start gmake and continue on failed include statements _although_ the 
</I>&gt;<i> 	files are missing.
</I>
It runs through, even includes are missing ? ugh!

&gt;<i> -	execute rules including the ones to create the include files
</I>&gt;<i> -	restart (re-exec) gmake with the saved args
</I>
Ah, that's probably because it should be able to create certain includes 
by itself, eg. autogenerated dependencies.
Actually, I don't like that approach - better use separate makefiles, 
a toplevel one which creates the deps and then calls the 2nd level one.

&gt;<i> 3 years ago, I reported a bug in the way gmake examines it's environment. This 
</I>&gt;<i> causes gmake to dump core under certain conditions. This bug could be fixed 
</I>&gt;<i> with a 2 line change that I send. The bug is still present in recent gname 
</I>&gt;<i> releases. I consider gmake to be an &quot;unmaintained program&quot; for this reason.
</I>
URL ?

&gt;<i> &gt; Yep, the tab/whitespace issue is an ugly thing. Back when I was learning
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (g)make, it caused me some headache ;-o
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There is no way to work around this gmake bug unless you like to make the 
</I>&gt;<i> makefile to fail on correct make implementations.
</I>
More precisely ?
 
&gt;<i> Rule of thumb: better try to fix the defective program instead of trying to 
</I>&gt;<i> work around the bugs.
</I>
ACK. That's exactly why I prefer certain fixes to be done within the 
toolchain instead of working around in each single app.

For example, win32's (IMHO meanwhile deprecated behaviour) of using
backlash instead of slash as directory delimiter can be handled 
within libc, so no more thousands of #ifdef's are needed anymore.

An more tricky example is the mmap() behaviour differing between
OS'es. This can't really fixed, since there is no standard you can
use as reference. IMHO, we should create one: 

* write some &quot;libmmap&quot; (or at least an include file) which either 
  sets appropriate symbols and maybe introduces some wrappers for
  specific cases.
* this lib has to be ported once per target platform
* packages which want to use mmap then exclusively use that new
  lib instead of the (then deprecated) mmap() call directly.

This can also be done with lots of similar problems.
