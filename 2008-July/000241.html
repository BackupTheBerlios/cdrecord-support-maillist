&gt;<i> &gt; b) it normally affects only those misdesigned packages which use 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    really obsoleted macros like AC_TRY_RUN, AC_CHECK_FILE or even
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    hand-written tests. In several hundreds of packages I had to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    cope with in recent years, there were just a few ones where it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    wasn't easy to get around this, but not a single one where it's 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    really impossible.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you believe that there are better methods, you would need to explain them.
</I>
Please remind me in about 6 weeks :)
I'll rework the configure script then ...

&gt;<i> &gt; For example:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * AC_CHECK_SIZEOF:  	a) there is sizeof()
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 			b) checking for a specific size is possible by compile-only
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> sizeof does not work for CPP, If you don't like this you cannot support Linux 
</I>&gt;<i> include file bugs.
</I>
IMHO normally not necessary. You simply can build test programs to try out 
certain sizes - *IF* you really can't work with sizeof(). For most cases this 
should be enough. 

&gt;<i> &gt; * AC_TYPE_PROTOTYPES:	IMHO not needed anymore, or is still somebody *really*
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;                         stick on old K&amp;R compiler ? ;-o
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Needed for e.g. HP-UX
</I>
Why not just using an more recent compiler, eg. gcc ?

&gt;<i> &gt; * AC_VAR_TIMEZONE:	if the variable exists, it could be assumed to work, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 			unless someone has an really broken libc. but then he should
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 			fix his broken system instead of holding individual 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 			packages responsible for hacking around his buggy system.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Needed for Mac OS X and *BSD. I have no idea how Apple managed to pass the POSIX
</I>&gt;<i> compliance tests....
</I>
Does that variable exist on osx+bsd, but doesnt work ? 
Why not just fixing the build environment (system headers, etc) then ?

&gt;<i> &gt; * AC_C_BITFIELDS:	IMHO not needed at all. sane libc's provide proper bytesex
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 			macros ;-P
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Try to inform you about C-compilers. Byte-order is independent from Bitorder in 
</I>&gt;<i> bitfields. Even the byteorder macros are not compatible across platforms.
</I>
Sorry, I was a bit heedless, mixed up bit and byte order (uhm, lack of coffein) ;-O

Actually, I didn't have the need for taking care of BITorder yet. 
Which platforms and which parts of the code does this affect

If there's *really* no other way around this, we simply could add an (mandatory)
configure option to explicitly define it (autodetection only happens explicitly
requested).

&gt;<i> &gt; * AC_TYPE_CHAR:		unnecessary. just explicitly desired signedness
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Wrong: needed on some platforms.
</I>
What about explicitly using &quot;signed char&quot; and &quot;unsigned char&quot; where it matters ?
IMHO, an compiler which doesnt support it, is broken ;-P

&gt;<i> &gt; * AC_FUNC_DTOA_R:	AFAIK, __dtoa() is an libc *internal* function, so don't 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 			use it at all.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Wrong: needed for *BSD and Mac OS X
</I>
It did some research on this issue and found many places which said, this is
an internal function and should not be used directly. Why/where exactly is
this required in cdrtools ?

&gt;<i> &gt; * AC_FUNC_ECVT:		same as w/ AC_VAR_TIMEZONE - if it exists, it can be assumed 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   AC_FUNC_FCVT		to work - don't try to hack around certain people's broken libc.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   AC_FUNC_GCVT
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It would be fun to see how you try to explain Ulrich Drepper how to fix 
</I>&gt;<i> the related bugs in glibc..... The last time I tried to do this, he anathematized 
</I>&gt;<i> like Rumpelstiltskin and I received a menacing mail from RedHat lawyers 3 hours 
</I>&gt;<i> later. David Korn had to calm down Mr. Drepper....
</I>
Well, I didn't say, evrything's perfect w/ glibc. There're still too many bugs
and standard violations. Please remind me in about 6 weeks, and I'll get back to
this issue. Might be that it's time for a fork ;-P
			
&gt;<i> &gt; * AC_FUNC_MLOCK:	same. HP-UX folks should fix their system or at least make the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   AC_FUNC_MLOCKALL:	compiling mlock() call fail.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You cannot even get the bugs in glibs fixed. How do you expect this to happen 
</I>&gt;<i> for old versions of HP-UX?
</I>
Use a fixed toolchain ;-P
Crosstool might be a proper place for that.

&gt;<i> &gt; * jsAC_FUNC_MMAP:	nearly the same (okay, requires a bit more magic ;-o)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Do you really like to drop support for Linux-2.4?
</I>
No, but I think there're other ways to fix this. Right, as I already said, 
this is not that trivial. Perhaps go the same way as I suggested with bit-order.

&gt;<i> &gt; * AC_FUNC_SYS_SIGLIST:	can be checked by compile
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Wrong
</I>
Why not exactly ?

&gt;<i> &gt; * AC_HEADER_MAKEDEV:	IMHO not needed at all - use the proper libc types/macros
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Wrong: there is no standard for this feature!!!!!!
</I>
Sorry, was a false alarm. It just does compile-test, which is fine for crosscompiling.

&gt;<i> &gt; * AC_USER_MALLOC:	not needed at all
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Wrong: Dou you like to drop Cygwin?
</I>
Why exactly ? Doesn't cygwin have a working malloc() ?

&gt;<i> &gt; * AC_FUNC_BSD_GETPGRP:	not needed. use getpgpid if you want another process' pg.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Wrong: needed for *BSD support
</I>
BSD doesn't have getpgpid ?

&gt;<i> &gt; * AC_HARD_SYMLINKS:	not used anywhere
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   AC_LINK_NOFOLLOW
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Wrong, needed for star
</I>
At least in 2.01.01, nothing seems to use the symbols defined by that macros.

&gt;<i> &gt; * AC_ACCESS_E_OK:	not needed, fix the broken libc.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Wrong: needed for many platforms. There is no standard for this!!!!!
</I>
It only seems to trigger an conditional #define for E_OK in your unistd.h,
but E_OK doesn't seem to be used anywhere. So why is this necessary at all ?

&gt;<i> &gt; BTW: most of these things are just hacks for a handful broken targets. Those things 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; could also be done via some --with-oshacks= swich.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> BTW: the target that includes the biggest number of bugs that need workarounds 
</I>&gt;<i> if Linux. Do you like me to drop Linux from the supported target platforms?
</I>
No, fix the bugs instead.
But this has to happen in proper places, not individual apps.

&gt;<i> BTW: I know two software sources for highly portable software. One is David Korn 
</I>&gt;<i> and Glenn Fowler and the other is me. Both sources use the same basic ideas for 
</I>&gt;<i> making the software highly portable. 
</I>
Including your counter bug ? ;-)
