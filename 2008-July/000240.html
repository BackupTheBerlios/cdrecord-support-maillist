</I>
If you believe that there are better methods, you would need to explain them.

    
&gt;<i> &gt; It is not possible to cross-compile such software unless you _manually_ 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; create _all_ expected auto-configuration results for the target platform.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No, you just have to learn living without that voodo stuff and instead
</I>&gt;<i> define *clear* configure options. And you also have to learn to properly
</I>&gt;<i> use the toolchain for doing the dirty work.
</I>
I am not sure about your experiences in portability. I am doing this since 25 
years. If you like to make a better proposal, I would of course be 
interested but you would need to prove that your method it still works for 
least the following platforms:

SunOS-4.x
SunOS-5.x (Solaris)
Linux-2.2-Linux-2.6
AIX
HP-UX
BeOS
*BSD (all flavors)
Interix (WIN-32 + SFU)
IRIX
Mac OS X
SCO OpenServer
SCO UnixWare
Win-32 + Cygwin
Hurd
True-64

&gt;<i> For example:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * AC_CHECK_SIZEOF:  	a) there is sizeof()
</I>&gt;<i> 			b) checking for a specific size is possible by compile-only
</I>
sizeof does not work for CPP, If you don't like this you cannot support Linux 
include file bugs.


&gt;<i> * AC_TYPE_PROTOTYPES:	IMHO not needed anymore, or is still somebody *really*
</I>&gt;<i>                         stick on old K&amp;R compiler ? ;-o
</I>
Needed for e.g. HP-UX
 		
       
&gt;<i> * AC_VAR_TIMEZONE:	if the variable exists, it could be assumed to work, 
</I>&gt;<i> 			unless someone has an really broken libc. but then he should
</I>&gt;<i> 			fix his broken system instead of holding individual 
</I>&gt;<i> 			packages responsible for hacking around his buggy system.
</I>
Needed for Mac OS X and *BSD. I have no idea how Apple managed to pass the POSIX
compliance tests....


&gt;<i> * AC_C_BITFIELDS:	IMHO not needed at all. sane libc's provide proper bytesex
</I>&gt;<i> 			macros ;-P
</I>
Try to inform you about C-compilers. Byte-order is independent from Bitorder in 
bitfields. Even the byteorder macros are not compatible across platforms.


&gt;<i> * AC_TYPE_CHAR:		unnecessary. just explicitly desired signedness
</I>
Wrong: needed on some platforms.


&gt;<i> * AC_FUNC_DTOA_R:	AFAIK, __dtoa() is an libc *internal* function, so don't 
</I>&gt;<i> 			use it at all.
</I>
Wrong: needed for *BSD and Mac OS X


&gt;<i> * AC_FUNC_ECVT:		same as w/ AC_VAR_TIMEZONE - if it exists, it can be assumed 
</I>&gt;<i>   AC_FUNC_FCVT		to work - don't try to hack around certain people's broken libc.
</I>&gt;<i>   AC_FUNC_GCVT
</I>
It would be fun to see how you try to explain Ulrich Drepper how to fix 
the related bugs in glibc..... The last time I tried to do this, he anathematized 
like Rumpelstiltskin and I received a menacing mail from RedHat lawyers 3 hours 
later. David Korn had to calm down Mr. Drepper....

 			
&gt;<i> * AC_FUNC_MLOCK:	same. HP-UX folks should fix their system or at least make the
</I>&gt;<i>   AC_FUNC_MLOCKALL:	compiling mlock() call fail.
</I>
You cannot even get the bugs in glibs fixed. How do you expect this to happen 
for old versions of HP-UX?
			
&gt;<i> * jsAC_FUNC_MMAP:	nearly the same (okay, requires a bit more magic ;-o)
</I>
Do you really like to drop support for Linux-2.4?


&gt;<i> * AC_FUNC_SYS_SIGLIST:	can be checked by compile
</I>
Wrong


&gt;<i> * AC_HEADER_MAKEDEV:	IMHO not needed at all - use the proper libc types/macros
</I>
Wrong: there is no standard for this feature!!!!!!

&gt;<i> * AC_USER_MALLOC:	not needed at all
</I>
Wrong: Dou you like to drop Cygwin?

&gt;<i> * AC_FUNC_BSD_GETPGRP:	not needed. use getpgpid if you want another process' pg.
</I>
Wrong: needed for *BSD support


&gt;<i> * AC_HARD_SYMLINKS:	not used anywhere
</I>&gt;<i>   AC_LINK_NOFOLLOW
</I>
Wrong, needed for star

&gt;<i> * AC_ACCESS_E_OK:	not needed, fix the broken libc.
</I>
Wrong: needed for many platforms. There is no standard for this!!!!!


&gt;<i> BTW: most of these things are just hacks for a handful broken targets. Those things 
</I>&gt;<i> could also be done via some --with-oshacks= swich.
</I>
BTW: the target that includes the biggest number of bugs that need workarounds 
if Linux. Do you like me to drop Linux from the supported target platforms?


&gt;<i> &gt; See above: no recent software allows cross-compilation unless you manually
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; create the auto-configuration results or fetch them from a native compilation
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; run on a machine of the same architecture and sub-architecture.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As said above: not true if the sw engineers did their homeworks ;-P
</I>
See above, you still have to prove your claim as you did not show me how to
live without tests that are run on the target platform. 

BTW: I know two software sources for highly portable software. One is David Korn 
and Glenn Fowler and the other is me. Both sources use the same basic ideas for 
making the software highly portable.
