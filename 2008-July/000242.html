FWIW, I thank those who make the effort to support operating
systems as they exist, and not to undertake political
activism within their project to make life difficult for
the user.  Also, when an o/s matures and its bugs and API
become frozen, it should be possible to include configure
tests in perpetuity to support it quite simply rather than
regard it as unworthy of support since 'development' on it
has ceased. Thousands of embedded applications still use
a flavor of DOS (many a genuine MS-DOS) for which the o/s
hasn't had a change in dozens of years.

The packages I respect the most build on the earliest versions
of unix (and workalikes) and many compile with K&amp;R C to this day.
For most of these, the configure process is elegant in comparison
to those of more 'discriminating' packages. One of the best that
I've seen (and used myself) is a configure system written for
Xylogics' software products, which build and run well on
unix-derivatives from the early 1980s to the present (for the
most part).  I personally regard 'autoconf' as an abomination
that should have been avoided in favor of less complex and
more manageable techniques well demonstrated by authors of
non-gnu software.
