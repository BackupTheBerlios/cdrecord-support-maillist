<PRE>I'm going nuts when I try to play DVDs containing
errors on my (IDE) DVD-ROM, e.g. scratched DVDs, under
Linux (Debian Sarge) using a Hitachi GD-2000 (and
another later model Hitachi) I'd like my system/DVD
player to limit its efforts in trying to re-read
sectors that are bad and continue reading following
sectors. Turning off read ahead on the block device is
suggested elsewhere but doesn't sufficiently help.

I seem to recall that readcd can be instructed to
limit retries so I suspect that a libscg based player
might help me solve my problems. Is there such a
beast? 

Enlightenment on the retry behaviour of the standard
Linux IDE disk driver and other suggestions would be
welcome. I don't want to apply any potentially
damaging procedures to these DVDs because they're not
mine - I do however try to clean them with a lint free
cloth in case you were wondering.

Thanks,

A.
