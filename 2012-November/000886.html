<PRE>Hi,

Thanks for taking the time to explain your understanding of the situation.

You write great software, and I now can read your (recent) thoughts on
the licensing. This is helpful to me, so, thank you.

Eric

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hello J&#246;rg (and others),
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I would maintain and include (at least) smake and cdrtools in Debian
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> nice to see. I hope that you know that if you are trying this for Debian or
</I>&gt;<i> Ubuntu, you will have to deal with modifications previously made to other
</I>&gt;<i> software also, that has been introduced into some packages in order to make it
</I>&gt;<i> hard to install the original cdrtools. There are hard to avoid dependencies to
</I>&gt;<i> a non working cdrtools variant created by a Debian packager. It may be that it
</I>&gt;<i> helps to check the existing packages from Brandon Snider to find a solution
</I>&gt;<i> for that problem. You may of course also ask if you are in doubt...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and Ubuntu Linux distributions. I'm concerned about the exception
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> clauses to both CDDL and GPL in the cdrtools 3.00 source distribution,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and multiple licenses or restrictions within the code and/or build
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In former times, this was not needed at all, as all users and distributors have
</I>&gt;<i> been interested in running and distributing working versions of cdrtools. Even
</I>&gt;<i> today, this is only needed for Linux distros, as there are no other OS distros
</I>&gt;<i> that try to intentionally ship defective own variants of cdrtools.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Around 2001, SuSE started to distribute non working modified versions of the
</I>&gt;<i> cdrtools under the original name and ignored the bug reports of their
</I>&gt;<i> customers/users.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As a result, I received _many_ mails each day from people who claimed that
</I>&gt;<i> cdrtools don't work. As a result, I was forced to spend a lot of time to inform
</I>&gt;<i> these people about that the original cdrtools do not have this bug, that they
</I>&gt;<i> are not using the original cdrtools and that switching to self compiled
</I>&gt;<i> binaires from the original sources will prevent the bugs from appearing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What SuSE did was a violation of the Copyright law (at least the European one)
</I>&gt;<i> and it is also in conflict with the preamble of the GPL. In addition, I am not
</I>&gt;<i> sure whether you are aware of the fact that none of the OSS licenses gives the
</I>&gt;<i> permission to use related trademarks also. The permission to use related
</I>&gt;<i> trademarks may require to follow additional rules.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In search for a solution to the problem caused by SuSE, there was a long
</I>&gt;<i> discussion with some Debian people and as the result of the negotioation, the
</I>&gt;<i> first variant of the text mentioned by you was introduced on October 16th 2001
</I>&gt;<i> with cdrtools 1.11a11. As you may read later, Debian after 2004 lost the
</I>&gt;<i> permission to use the related trademarks because the repsonsible packager was
</I>&gt;<i> not willing to ship working versions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But as you are interested to package the original cdrtools, it seems to be that
</I>&gt;<i> you are interested in shippig working versions, so it should be obvious that
</I>&gt;<i> the text does not apply to you.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I.e. &quot;Begin restricted code for quality assurance.&quot;  (cdrecord/cdrecord.c:362)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have read that debian-legal rejected the instruction that code
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (having to do with the build system detecting modified code or build
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> system, in this example) is not allowed to be modified;  it is thus a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> restriction of freedom and so does not follow the Debian Free Software
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Guidelines.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am not sure from where you have this claim.....Debian did not reject this
</I>&gt;<i> text. Debian rather helped writing it. As you see in my description above, the
</I>&gt;<i> related text was originally introduced as agreed with Debian and in compliance
</I>&gt;<i> with the DFSG.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I remember however, that some years ago, one of the Debian &quot;leaders&quot; claimed
</I>&gt;<i> that he does not care about the written text in the DFSG but decides from his
</I>&gt;<i> gut....
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A reason why some people from Debian may spread incorrect information about
</I>&gt;<i> cdrtools is that in Spring 2004 the &quot;old&quot; Debian packager for cdrtools left
</I>&gt;<i> because of a lack of time after he finished his uiversity diploma and a new
</I>&gt;<i> packager (Eduard Bloch) was determinated. This person soon started a similar
</I>&gt;<i> game as SuSE did in 2001 and created own defective variants since May 2004.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Please also note that the text in question has been updated several times in
</I>&gt;<i> order to make it more obvious. Cdrtools-3.00 is from June 2010. The latest
</I>&gt;<i> text version is from August 2007, so even though cdrtools-3.00 is very
</I>&gt;<i> outdated now, the recent text is the same. Please read it carefully and do not
</I>&gt;<i> forget to also read the file cdrecord/LIMITATIONS that should give additional
</I>&gt;<i> help to understand the intention.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also note that the current code variant distributed on Debian was derived from
</I>&gt;<i> cdrtools-2.01 from September 2004 and at that time, cdrtools did include these
</I>&gt;<i> clauses since nearly 3 years. In other words: Debian currently distributes a
</I>&gt;<i> cdrtools varian where the clause clearly applies.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The instruction about &quot;&quot;not being allowed to modify code&quot;&quot; and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;restricted code&quot; sections is the basis on which cdrtools 2.xx was
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> removed from the Debian archives. Is there an acceptable,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> DFSG-compatible way to let the user know an appropriate venue for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> technical support?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Possible solutions?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> None needed as cdrtools is fully compliant with the OSS guidelines from
</I>&gt;<i> Opensource.org and with the DFSG and as this has been agreed on with Debian
</I>&gt;<i> more than 10 years ago already.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I hope this explanation was helpful to you.
