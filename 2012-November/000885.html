Hi,

nice to see. I hope that you know that if you are trying this for Debian or 
Ubuntu, you will have to deal with modifications previously made to other 
software also, that has been introduced into some packages in order to make it 
hard to install the original cdrtools. There are hard to avoid dependencies to 
a non working cdrtools variant created by a Debian packager. It may be that it 
helps to check the existing packages from Brandon Snider to find a solution 
for that problem. You may of course also ask if you are in doubt...

&gt;<i> and Ubuntu Linux distributions. I'm concerned about the exception
</I>&gt;<i> clauses to both CDDL and GPL in the cdrtools 3.00 source distribution,
</I>&gt;<i> and multiple licenses or restrictions within the code and/or build
</I>&gt;<i> system.
</I>
In former times, this was not needed at all, as all users and distributors have 
been interested in running and distributing working versions of cdrtools. Even 
today, this is only needed for Linux distros, as there are no other OS distros
that try to intentionally ship defective own variants of cdrtools.

Around 2001, SuSE started to distribute non working modified versions of the 
cdrtools under the original name and ignored the bug reports of their 
customers/users.

As a result, I received _many_ mails each day from people who claimed that 
cdrtools don't work. As a result, I was forced to spend a lot of time to inform 
these people about that the original cdrtools do not have this bug, that they 
are not using the original cdrtools and that switching to self compiled 
binaires from the original sources will prevent the bugs from appearing.

What SuSE did was a violation of the Copyright law (at least the European one)
and it is also in conflict with the preamble of the GPL. In addition, I am not
sure whether you are aware of the fact that none of the OSS licenses gives the
permission to use related trademarks also. The permission to use related 
trademarks may require to follow additional rules.

In search for a solution to the problem caused by SuSE, there was a long 
discussion with some Debian people and as the result of the negotioation, the 
first variant of the text mentioned by you was introduced on October 16th 2001
with cdrtools 1.11a11. As you may read later, Debian after 2004 lost the 
permission to use the related trademarks because the repsonsible packager was 
not willing to ship working versions.

But as you are interested to package the original cdrtools, it seems to be that 
you are interested in shippig working versions, so it should be obvious that 
the text does not apply to you. 

&gt;<i> I.e. &quot;Begin restricted code for quality assurance.&quot;  (cdrecord/cdrecord.c:362)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have read that debian-legal rejected the instruction that code
</I>&gt;<i> (having to do with the build system detecting modified code or build
</I>&gt;<i> system, in this example) is not allowed to be modified;  it is thus a
</I>&gt;<i> restriction of freedom and so does not follow the Debian Free Software
</I>&gt;<i> Guidelines.
</I>
I am not sure from where you have this claim.....Debian did not reject this 
text. Debian rather helped writing it. As you see in my description above, the 
related text was originally introduced as agreed with Debian and in compliance 
with the DFSG.

I remember however, that some years ago, one of the Debian &quot;leaders&quot; claimed 
that he does not care about the written text in the DFSG but decides from his 
gut.... 

A reason why some people from Debian may spread incorrect information about 
cdrtools is that in Spring 2004 the &quot;old&quot; Debian packager for cdrtools left 
because of a lack of time after he finished his uiversity diploma and a new 
packager (Eduard Bloch) was determinated. This person soon started a similar 
game as SuSE did in 2001 and created own defective variants since May 2004. 

Please also note that the text in question has been updated several times in 
order to make it more obvious. Cdrtools-3.00 is from June 2010. The latest 
text version is from August 2007, so even though cdrtools-3.00 is very 
outdated now, the recent text is the same. Please read it carefully and do not
forget to also read the file cdrecord/LIMITATIONS that should give additional
help to understand the intention.

Also note that the current code variant distributed on Debian was derived from 
cdrtools-2.01 from September 2004 and at that time, cdrtools did include these
clauses since nearly 3 years. In other words: Debian currently distributes a 
cdrtools varian where the clause clearly applies.


&gt;<i> The instruction about &quot;&quot;not being allowed to modify code&quot;&quot; and
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;restricted code&quot; sections is the basis on which cdrtools 2.xx was
</I>&gt;<i> removed from the Debian archives. Is there an acceptable,
</I>&gt;<i> DFSG-compatible way to let the user know an appropriate venue for
</I>&gt;<i> technical support?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Possible solutions?
</I>
None needed as cdrtools is fully compliant with the OSS guidelines from 
Opensource.org and with the DFSG and as this has been agreed on with Debian 
more than 10 years ago already.

I hope this explanation was helpful to you.
