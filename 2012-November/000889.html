OK, thank you for the information.

BTW: The reply I send you before was not related to my thoughts on licensing.
If you like to know something on my thoughts about licensing, you would need to 
ask something different ;-)

I was just trying to answer your question about why/when a specific phrase 
appeared in the comments of cdrecord and tried to explain you what 
happened before and what caused the current general situation with Debian. I
also tried to explian that (before the hostile Eduard Bloch appeared) there 
was a very good relationship with Debian.

Regarding legal analysis... I am not sure whether you know that this more or 
less passed already on March 6th 2009 at CeBIT where Simon Phipps (Director 
from OpenSource.org) talked with several people from Debian and received the 
promise from Debian to include the original cdrtools within aprox. 3 months 
into Debian again.

So if you are in a discussion with people from Debian, you would need to be 
careful to avoid to get to the same people again that caused the current 
problem.


If you have any further problem, feel free to contact me as it seems that 
everything was discussed already with people from Debian and it may help to 
know results from former similar discussions to get better arguments for a 
discussion ;-)

In special, it could help you to know that J&#246;rg Jaspert promised to personally 
work on reintegration of the original cdrtools in March 2009 to Simon Phipps 
but rather tried to temporize and after a year admitted, that he did not work 
on the reintegration but rather convinced others not do do that....
