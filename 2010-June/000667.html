Just for the record, IIRC, they did that because they were worried
about exploits that corrupt firmware. IMHO, the issue stems not from
applications or even OSes, but rather from the shortsightedness of
the drive industry. They should have made a clear command distinction
between normal media writes and firmware updates. In fact, there should
be uniform protocols and safeguards so that one single application can
be used to access and update the firmware of every EEPROM in the system
including the motherboard BIOS, etc. Of course, making it uniform
would weaken &quot;the security of obscurity&quot;, but at least then only one
clearly seen and understood attack pathway would need be secured with
regard to firmware and normal applications would not be inconvenienced.

And another rant: every firmware should have a non-writable factory
default backup copy. The use of this copy would be determined by a
single system wide memory area value which can be centrally set (via
the BIOS or at boot) and totally overridden by a single hardware dip
switch. Thus, even if every single firmware on the system is totally
corrupt, you can flip one dip switch to cause the fixed backups to be
used on every card in the system and then reprogram/restore/update all
the EEPROMS using a single piece of administrative software.

 .... I guess we all can have our dreams. LOL.
