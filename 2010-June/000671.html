<PRE>Hi,
I hope this is an appropriate context to follow up on my question regarding md5 sums.
(Pls let me know if another forum would be more appropriate for this).
It seems that md5sums can't be used with cdda2wav yet to compare source and output
of burning a CDDA (which is what I am trying to accomplish). The reason for this seem
to be different read and write offset in the device that created the CD and the device that
is trying to read it. In my case it would be the same device. Is the readoffset and the
write offset usually the same for a single device (repsectively, how does one find out)?

On a broader level, I am wondering what the 'standard' way of comparing source and output
for CDDA is. I haven't been able to find anything online so far (there  doesn't appear
to be a straightforward method like there is for data CDs). Given the ubiquity of CDDA, millions
of people must have tried to accomplish that before me, but I am at a loss as to how...

In the absence of a 'standard' method, I had to more thoughts of what might work and would
appreciate your comments.

1)Even if there is no md5 way of comparing, might a good drive tell me of C2 errors etc during burning
and thus give me a sufficient degree of confidence that nothing went wrong?

2) From what I understand, the CDDA track is padded compared to the .wav. Would it be possible to
'align' the data chunks of the original .wav and the .wav ripped from the cdda (i.e. remove leading and
trailing zeroes in the ripped .wav) and then diff the chunks?

Thanks for you consideration.

Best Regards,
Michael
