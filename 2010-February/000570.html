Yes, that is what mkisofs does (just as its name implies) - makes an ISO
filesystem &quot;file/image&quot; from a list of directories/files. And that's the
reason for the Joilet/Rock Ridge stuff - to store extra information found
in MS Windows or Unix filesystems that is not supported by ISO-9660.
Unless there is a filesystem, the OS won't be able to mount it, but the
data will still be there.

BTW, I think this issue is going to become a big deal with respect to
copying files between different mounted filesystems. The most important
features of ISO-9660 are that it lays out the files in ways that make it
easier and faster to access and makes it possible to append to later with
&quot;sequential-like&quot; access devices such as CD/DVDs.

To recover Mark's backup.tar.bz2, he could try:

dd if=/dev/dvd of=backup.tar.bz2

Now, IIRC, there is an issue regarding the length of the file. 
CDs/ISO-9660 usually uses a 2K (2048) sector size (and most CDs use this
as a block size, but see the mkisofs man page as there are exceptions),
so .iso images should be a multiple of 2048. 

I'm not exactly sure what cdrecord/linux/Unix does if it is fed a file
that is not a multiple of 2K. A problem may come in when one wants to
recover the exact original file without any trailing padding sectors.

For this reason, and to serve as a check/safeguard that a drive does not
try to read past EOF (or something else in the system appending zeros), I
usually record the number of 1K blocks (or bytes if your file is not a
multiple of 1K long) as well as the md5sum of any image or data I write
to a CD/DVD.

Then, I can do things like:

dd if=/dev/dvd bs=1k count=1077 | md5sum -

to verify the burn.

BTW, a few years ago I asked some questions and got some answers related
to using filesystem images other than ISO-9660:

However, I mainly still use ISO-9660 with Rock Ridge extensions today.


  Cheers,

  Mike Shell
