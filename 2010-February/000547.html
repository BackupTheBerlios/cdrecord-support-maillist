<PRE>Hi Joerg,

I wasn't specifically trying to help with the tests, but I had some
instructional DVD's I'd offered to copy for someone before I realized
what an issue that task would be with linux (8 total). That led me to
cdrtools and everything seemed to work pretty well last weekend for
about 3 DVD's. 

I since upgraded to the 075 version (on CentOS 5.4) and it's very
hit-or-miss, I've only managed to burn 2 good DVD's trying with both
Sony DVD-R or Phillips DVD-R. Last weekend what worked was using the
nautilus (desktop) copy cd or burn image to cd option; using the
command-line 'cdrecord' worked but the dvd menu didn't work for a
couple of them so the first part (title) of the dvd was unable to
be viewed.

Today and yesterday that method hasn't worked at all, so I used K9copy
to make an iso and only 1 has burned correctly using the command-line,
at least 3 others won't come up with anything in my DVD player. And one
had an error burning, here's the output:

Track 01:    0 of 3562 MB written.cdrecord: Input/output error.

cdrecord: fifo had 128 puts and 1 gets.
cdrecord: fifo was 0 times empty and 0 times full, min fill was 100%.

I was logged into a terminal as the root user and the command I used
was: cdrecord -v dev=/dev/scd0 -gracetime=2 speed=4 /path
to/dvd_DVD5.iso I'm going to keep trying but I thought I'd pass that
on. I have 3 more to try to copy from iso.

I just burned 2 more coasters so I give up for today, or I'll go to
Fedora (13'ish) and try there. I used the nautilus 'burn to disk' for
the iso file and it burned but the beginning of the dvd has no menu and
the video is very choppy. So I tried the command-line again using a
Phillips dvd instead of a Sony and got the same error as above. Here's
the output from -minfo after the burn error:
