<PRE>Hi all,

I'm having an issue with a new Bluray writer that we've purchased and hoping
you can identify what the issue is.  The whole Bluray media is brand new to
me so perhaps this is so common no one mentions it.

I'll give a summary first and then details.  

I downloaded the latest cdrecord (now slightly out of date) and tried to 
burn my first BD.  I also just downloaded the latest (cdrtools-2.01.01a72)
and I still get the same problem with -minfo as described below.

First problem, which it appears to be a known issue, is that I can't do a
dummy write.  This is how I usually determine if my iso image is the right
size.

But I dropped in the bd_simul driver and used that.  Eventually got an
image that claimed to have 924 blocks remaining.

So I moved on to the actual burn:
  # /opt/schily/bin/cdrecord -v  -dev=2,0,0 data.raw
  ...
  /opt/schily/bin/cdrecord: Disk capacity is unknown.
  /opt/schily/bin/cdrecord: Data will not fit on any CD.
  /opt/schily/bin/cdrecord: DVD/BD capacity is unknown.
  /opt/schily/bin/cdrecord: Cannot write more than remaining DVD/BD capacity.

  and exits.

After some digging around I determined that it appears that cdrecord can't
get media info and so declines to write:
  
  # cdrecord -dev=2,0,0 -minfo
  Disk type: DVD, HD-DVD or BD

  Track  Sess Type   Start Addr End Addr   Size
  ==============================================
      1     1 Data   0          -1         0
  
  Last session start address:         0
  Last session leadout start address: 0

But it reads DVD media fine and senses that there is media there (or not)
so at some level things are working correctly.

So...  Tried to force the burn (as it turns out, successfully):
  # /opt/schily/bin/cdrecord -ignsize -dev=2,0,0 -speed=3 data.raw
  ...
  Track 01: Total bytes read/written: 25023391744/25023391744 (12218453
   sectors).

I've read the data back on the same writer and two different Bluray readers
and all the checksums match.

So at this point I'd like to determine where/what the problem is so that I
don't have to go thru the extra hoop of blindly burning the data and hoping
it works.

Is it the media, the drive or cdrecord?  Is it fixable?  And if so by whom?

===


I will now start putting in the details.  I'm kind of hoping the above
summary will help you quickly focus on where the problem lies.

If you need additional data please let me know.

If there is something obvious that I missed, please give me the benefit of
the doubt and trust that I have tried to read thru man pages and other
documentation first.  If this is answered somewhere then I missed it.

  All downloaded straight from the ftp site and compiled (first with Gmake
  and then I went back and got Smake, did a distclean on cdrecord and started
  over.

  Made no difference

I'm still stripping out some of the excess output, otherwise this message will
be twice as long:

  .. and cdrecord exits.

As I said, read the data back on this writer and two different readers and
everything checksums.  So I conclude the data was written successfully.
