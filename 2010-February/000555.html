<PRE>Am I supposed to use mkisofs or something else BEFORE writing data
backups to a DVD+R disc? Is there a good web page on doing this with
cdrtools? All the pages I'm finding are for using GUI frontends and I
want to learn to do this from the command line.

I've never used cdrecord from the command line to do backups so I
thought as a test I would try writing a large tar file to a DVD+R disc
as data. The command I used was about as simple as possible and
probably not right:

cdrecord dev=1001,0,0 backup.tar.bz2

The command seemed to have executed so I ejected the disc and took it
to another system where I tried:

firefly ~ # mount -t iso9660 /dev/dvdrw /mnt/tmpMnt/
mount: block device /dev/sr0 is write-protected, mounting read-only
mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/sr0,
       missing codepage or helper program, or other error
       In some cases useful info is found in syslog - try
       dmesg | tail  or so

firefly ~ #

firefly ~ # cdrecord --version
Cdrecord-ProDVD-ProBD-Clone 2.01.01a75 (x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu)
Copyright (C) 1995-2010 J&#65533;&#65533;rg Schilling
firefly ~ #

Now, what filesystem do I specify for this sort of disc? Is it iso9660
or something else? Possibly I should either state what I want when I
write the disc or maybe I have to use something like mkisofs before I
write the disc?

PLEASE keep in mind that I don't know what OR WHERE mkisofs works.
Does it create something new on my hard drive or does it prepare the
DVD+R live. I'm almost out of disk space on the system being backed up
and don't have another 5GB to create some big *.iso file. Am I hosed?

All I want is when I put this disc in a PC later that I see one
backup.tar.bz2 file which I can copy off and untar to retrieve the
backup data.

Thanks,
Mark
