</I>

If I understand correctly, -graft-points without an &quot;=&quot; remapping,
will assume the target (in the image, the specifier to the *left* any =)
is the root directory on the ISO image. Also, -graft-points can be
used to get a directory *and* its contents into the image, while pathspec
will only place the *contents* of the given directory at the root
of the image.

So, for the example above, if foo.avi and quux.avi are to be placed in
the root of the ISO image, one could do:


-graft-points c:\\foo.avi f:\\bar\\quux.avi


which is the same as:


-graft-points /=c:\\foo.avi /=f:\\bar\\quux.avi 


and would result in

foo.avi
quux.avi 

in the root (/) directory of the image.

I would be nice if there was a &quot;-graft-points-list&quot; 
(note there already is a -hidden-list in mkisofs) to allow
us to have an external .txt file with the file list:


-graft-points-list myfiles.txt


where myfiles.txt had lines like:


c:\\foo.avi
f:\\bar\\quux.avi  


which is what I think Phil really wants.

One gotcha to watch out for mentioned in the mkisofs man page is:

:<i> By default, any directories that are created on the fly like
</I>:<i> this will have permissions 0555 and appear to be owned by the
</I>:<i> person running mkisofs. If you wish other permissions or owners
</I>:<i> of the inter-mediate directories, see -uid, -gid, -dir-mode,
</I>:<i> -file-mode and -new-dir-mode.
</I>

It always seemed to me that something was less than well thought
out with the likes of tar and other image creation and use
in general. (In what follows, my comments are not specific to
mkisofs, but perhaps to Unix and removable media in general.)

There are four basic types of images/disks:

1. Archival - every file ownership and mode should be unchanged.
   Furthermore, their should be an optional file that includes
   the mapping information from numerical to strings of all the
   uid/gid of included files, e.g., mshell:551:551:Michael Shell
   to allow for optional inter-system copying based on the login
   name when it can be assumed they are unqiue. (e.g., allow &quot;mshell&quot;
   files to be copied from a system where mshell has uid 551 to
   one with uid 560). At a deeper level, it would nice to be able
   to present a &quot;login alias&quot; to removable media - e.g., &quot;zork&quot; on
   this system is really &quot;mshell&quot; on the image.

2. Public distribution - every file should be owned by the person
   currently *accessing* the image. This, the file ownership depends
   on who mounts the image. Alternatively, there could be a generic
   world-readable user &quot;User&quot;.

3. Private distribution - every file should be owned by the person
   currently *making* the image. 

4. Administration disks - for restricted use, such as files that
   can only be read/executed by root. All files are owned by root.
   
It would be nice if there was a simple switch to select between
the basic modes with stuff like -uid, -gid to allow for more
detailed customization.


  Cheers,

  Mike Shell
