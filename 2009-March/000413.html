Maybe it's time to write the smart-answers part too...

Oh, it's there:


    How To Answer Questions in a Helpful Way

/Be gentle./ Problem-related stress can make people seem rude or stupid
even when they're not.

/Reply to a first offender off-line./ There is no need of public
humiliation for someone who may have made an honest mistake. A real
newbie may not know how to search archives or where the FAQ is stored or
posted.

/If you don't know for sure, say so!/ A wrong but authoritative-sounding
answer is worse than none at all. Don't point anyone down a wrong path
simply because it's fun to sound like an expert. Be humble and honest;
set a good example for both the querent and your peers.

/If you can't help, don't hinder./ Don't make jokes about procedures
that could trash the user's setup &#8212; the poor sap might interpret these
as instructions.

/Ask probing questions to elicit more details./ If you're good at this,
the querent will learn something &#8212; and so might you. Try to turn the bad
question into a good one; remember we were all newbies once.

While muttering RTFM is sometimes justified when replying to someone who
is just a lazy slob, a pointer to documentation (even if it's just a
suggestion to google for a key phrase) is better.

/If you're going to answer the question at all, give good value./ Don't
suggest kludgy workarounds when somebody is using the wrong tool or
approach. Suggest good tools. Reframe the question.

/Help your community learn from the question./ When you field a good
question, ask yourself &#8220;How would the relevant documentation or FAQ have
to change so that nobody has to answer this again?&#8221; Then send a patch to
the document maintainer.

If you did research to answer the question, /demonstrate your skills
rather than writing as though you pulled the answer out of your
butt./ Answering one good question is like feeding a hungry person one
meal, but teaching them research skills by example is showing them how
to grow food for a lifetime.
