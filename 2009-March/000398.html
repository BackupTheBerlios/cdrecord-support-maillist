Joe, do show us an example. The interaction between -graft-points
and -path-list is not clear to me. I didn't know one could list *files*
within the -path-list file. I assume these default to the root
directory of the image. Do you mean that one can use -path-list
to include a large number of files (and contents of directories) to
the root directory of the image without exceeding the maximum command
line length, however, to map files to arbitrary paths on the
image one has to use -graft-points and thus the command line limit
becomes an issue. If so, there still is a need for a -graft-points-list.

There is an interesting article by an IT guy related to this concerning
Windows 7:

<A HREF="http://blogs.eweek.com/signaling_it/content001/security/getting_real_work_done.html">http://blogs.eweek.com/signaling_it/content001/security/getting_real_work_done.html</A>
 
One of the great things about Unix is the multiple levels of
configuration (for applications that are done correctly). There's
a system wide setting in /etc and per-user settings in .files
in the user's home directory. This way, the machine can be set
by root with a default configuration for all users, and each
user can override as needed (without needing root privileges).

It is also possible to have /home/mydir/bin and reconfigure
PATH to allow for user executables.

The reason for the concept of file ownership is security. It
can be a pain to get used to, but in the long run it can
save time by not having to deal so much with broken or
compromised systems.

Unix guru Henry Spencer said, &quot;Those who do not understand
Unix are condemned to reinvent it, poorly.&quot; I think Microsoft
has been heading in that direction for some time.
