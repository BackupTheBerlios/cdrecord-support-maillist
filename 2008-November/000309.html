	Yes, the dependency from libfind.

	cdrtools works fine for me without having ACL support installed and
therefore compiled against.*

	I personally have a single user box, and don't need the overhead of
ACL.  Standard/Classic Unix users and groups are enough for me and my
uses.  Further I could imagine a setup where you had a rather embedded
system (PVR with DVD-R burning capabilities) that wouldn't need the
overhead of ACL either.
	So not strictly requiring ACL is a good thing from my perspective.
Which, again, your software appears to do just fine.


* NOTE: I personally am using only using the older 2.01.01a34, and I'm
assuming that the latest versions will work without ACL as well.

&gt;<i> Q1:	Wouldn't it be better to treat things similar on Linux?
</I>
	That's a question for someone with more brains than me.  :)  I'm just a
user, not Mr. Torvalds.

&gt;<i> Q2:	Is there no support for dependencies on Gentoo that knows that
</I>&gt;<i> 	ACL support is still &quot;in use&quot; and cannot be removed before all other
</I>&gt;<i> 	ACL users have been removed also?
</I>
	The Gentoo Devs problem is more with tracking that dependency.  You
kind of surprise them, as they don't realize you've linked against ACL
really.  They want explicit control over the use of ACL.  They want to
be able to tell cdrtools's build system to not use ACL, even if it is on
the system at this moment.
	This boils down (I think) to conditionally settings the USE_ACL define
(it looks like it's always being enabled in libfind's .mk files) via the
make/build system.  Via an environment variable or something?
