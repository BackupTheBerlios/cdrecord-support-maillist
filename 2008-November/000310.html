&gt;<i> &gt; I would call this a Linux distro problem. I believe that ACL support is a basic

In case of cdrtools, you are correct...

However, cdrtools is only a small part of my sources that are compiled
inside a common source tree. Other libfind users (star, sfind, ...) need the
ACL support. The ACL calls are inside libfind....

In any case, it is wrong to do an incomplete configure run just because there is
a problem with the dependency handling in Gentoo.

&gt;<i> 	So not strictly requiring ACL is a good thing from my perspective.
</I>&gt;<i> Which, again, your software appears to do just fine.
</I>
On Solaris ACL support is unconditionally built into many basic programs like
ls(1), chmod(1), cp(1), .... It may be that people who like to support small
embedded systems think differently but ACL support does not cause overhead or
makes the system slow.

&gt;<i> * NOTE: I personally am using only using the older 2.01.01a34, and I'm
</I>&gt;<i> assuming that the latest versions will work without ACL as well.
</I>
This is because of a bug and because you did not have ACL support when you 
compiled a34. a34 will not compile correctly on Linux if there is ACL support.


&gt;<i> &gt; Q1:	Wouldn't it be better to treat things similar on Linux?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 	That's a question for someone with more brains than me.  :)  I'm just a
</I>&gt;<i> user, not Mr. Torvalds.
</I>
This is not something to discuss with mr. Torvalds but this is a distro 
decision.


&gt;<i> &gt; Q2:	Is there no support for dependencies on Gentoo that knows that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	ACL support is still &quot;in use&quot; and cannot be removed before all other
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	ACL users have been removed also?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 	The Gentoo Devs problem is more with tracking that dependency.  You
</I>&gt;<i> kind of surprise them, as they don't realize you've linked against ACL
</I>&gt;<i> really.  They want explicit control over the use of ACL.  They want to
</I>&gt;<i> be able to tell cdrtools's build system to not use ACL, even if it is on
</I>&gt;<i> the system at this moment.
</I>
Well, of course Gentoo would need to create a list of dependencies that if 
valid for Gentoo. The packaging system would need to prevent ACL removal in 
case that there is a user for ACL code.

Note that on Solaris, basic OS features are always installed (and ACL support
is inside Solaris since 1993). 

The way many Linux distributions work looks like a  closed source environment 
from Microsoft as you explicitly need to first install &quot;additional&quot; support for
basic OS features before you may use these features.

&gt;<i> 	This boils down (I think) to conditionally settings the USE_ACL define
</I>&gt;<i> (it looks like it's always being enabled in libfind's .mk files) via the
</I>&gt;<i> make/build system.  Via an environment variable or something?
</I>
The patch on your bugsystem is definitely wrong as it simply destroys correct
behavior of &quot;configure&quot;.

With the latest preliminary source you may call make COPTX=-DNO_ACL &quot;LIB_ACL_TEST= &quot;

Note that this is a hack and definitely wrong in case you like to do dynamic 
linking which has been made default for now. To disable dynamic linking, you 
would need to add LINKMODE=static in addition.
