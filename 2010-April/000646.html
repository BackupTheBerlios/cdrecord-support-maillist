Are you sure that cdparanoia has this feature? Cdparanoia is based
on a very old versioon of cdda2wav and thus does not implement most of the
features found in recent cdda2wav versions. Cdparanoia is also non-prtable
and Linux only while cdda2wav works on more than 30 different OS platforms.

&gt;<i> (<A HREF="http://gna.org/projects/cued">http://gna.org/projects/cued</A>) have the capability to apply sample

</I>&gt;<i> to &quot;recover&quot; these normally missed samples.

It is most unlikely that this program will help you. It is based on libcdio
and libcdio was created from an outdated version of cdda2wav and is even 
in conflict with the copyright law as the license was changed to GPLv3 without 
the permission of the Author.. 

Knowing the code from libcdio, it seems to be very unlikely that libcdio is 
portable software. ....just checked: it is far away from being portable.

&gt;<i> Please note this feature request is not intended to spark a discussion
</I>&gt;<i> on the merits of AccurateRip(TM) compatibility, or &quot;what is zero
</I>&gt;<i> (reference) anyways?&quot; It is just a feature that I would find useful if
</I>&gt;<i> it were implemented. CDROM drive hardware varies a lot about which
</I>&gt;<i> sample to begin reading from, and being able to compensate for this is
</I>&gt;<i> important for my uses. I am surprised that a sample offset
</I>&gt;<i> compensation read feature does not appear to be implemented already in
</I>&gt;<i> cdrtools.
</I>
Well, the features in cdda2wav are oriented on importance and offset correction
is a task of low importance if you think of general audio extraction quality
and if you look at the ability to extrace meta data from or for audio CDs.
With general audio extraction quality, cdda2wav is one of the very best 
programs and e.g. better than cdparanoia. Cdda2wav reads many audio CDs 
without problems that cannot be read using cdparanoia at all.

The next planned feature for cdda2wav is the ability to detect stable incorrect 
audio data and after that, offset correction is planned.

Note that the typical audio read offset is less than 20ms and you will need to 
create a 20th or 50th stage copy in order to be able to notice the offset at 
all.
