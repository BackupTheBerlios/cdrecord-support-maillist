Oh yes, it can happen and did to me about 3-4 months ago. Something
smoked - I think the main power supply. It took out the main drive, an
additional hard drive as well as a VGA card, the motherboard and the
processor. I think a sound card and a NIC are all that survived.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I generally physically disconnect the backup drives from the system.
</I>&gt;<i> Not only does this protect against power supply problems (esp. lightning),
</I>&gt;<i> but also helps to protect against hackers, accidents or malicious software
</I>&gt;<i> bugs, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Of course, there cannot be any of these serious problems when the drive
</I>&gt;<i> is inserted into the system. I often use a standalone boot disk when
</I>&gt;<i> doing restores.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> My backup strategy then changed to using external USB drives as the backup
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> drives. USB limits current and the converter circuit would most likely
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> protect the drive in a bad power situation. But I still was not sleeping
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> well at night. So, I purchased a used Primera Composer robotic disk handler
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and wrote the software to control it. Now I can make a full backup and store
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it off site, and every night the software checks to see if it should burn an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> incremental disk. If it does, it emails me and I know to go to the basement
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to pick up the disk to take to offsite storage. Short of a nuclear strike,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> my data is well protected.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This sounds great. If you haven't already you could post about it somewhere
</I>&gt;<i> as other people might be interested in it too. ;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I use  external USB drives running on a separate, small UPS's and I've
gotten so paranoid that I actually place an unpowered USB hub between
the PC and the external drive just hoping that if one of the two (USB
drive or PC) goes really bad that the hub will fry and protect the
other from a similar failure.

That said nothing protects you from the house burning down other than
off site backups...
