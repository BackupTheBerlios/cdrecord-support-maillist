  Mark,

Although I have yet to get around to learning the details of bootable
CD's, I do know a bit about the boot process on hard drives.

The problem is that a bootable disk must contain boot loader code, not
just files.

I think you are asking about how to make &quot;El Torito&quot; bootable disks:

<A HREF="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Bootdisk-HOWTO/cd-roms.html">http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Bootdisk-HOWTO/cd-roms.html</A>
<A HREF="http://odin.himinbi.org/xp_cds/eltorito_extraction.html">http://odin.himinbi.org/xp_cds/eltorito_extraction.html</A>

That would involve the use of the mkisofs -b and possibly -hard-disk-boot
options - if you really do need to use mkisofs (see below).

The second URL above takes you through the process of acquiring the boot
code, but it does involve picking through a hexdump.

I do not understand this:

&gt;<i> In the past I've used mkisofs to rip iso images of Windows operating
</I>&gt;<i> system disks (Win98, Me &amp; XP) to do an install in VMWare-Workstation.
</I>&gt;<i> I suspect my old command might not be appropriate anymore?
</I>
What I don't get is why mkisofs would be used if all you want to do is
duplicate the disks nor do I understand why so doing would ever result
in a bootable CD if the -b option was never invoked.

From the second URL above:

:<i> Making a straight copy is easy enough, except the sand eats all discs here
</I>:<i> and I don't really want a disc anyhow. I just want to be able to make one.
</I>:<i>
</I>:<i> With linux this is pretty easy to pull off.
</I>:<i> dd if=/dev/scd0 of=isos/win_xp.iso
</I>:<i>
</I>:<i> will give me a iso image that I can verify is good by doing:
</I>:<i> mount -o loop win_xp.iso /mnt/winxp/
</I>:<i>
</I>:<i> When I get ready to burn it I just do:
</I>:<i> cdrecord -v speed=2 dev=0,0 ~will/isos/win_xp.iso
</I>:<i>
</I>:<i> This is all fine and good, but I would like to keep the key with the disc.
</I>:<i> My initial idea was just to mount the iso image and try writing into it.
</I>:<i> The structure of an iso though prevents this from working. A simple solution
</I>:<i> is just to copy the files out and make a new iso. The problem? The disc is
</I>:<i> bootable and it won't be if I just make a new image. I need to copy the boot
</I>:<i> image out and put it in the new one.
</I>

I am not totally sure about &quot;would like to keep the key with the disc&quot;,  but if
I understand him correctly, he wants to add a little .txt file that holds the
registration key to the image, which is why he needs to reconstruct the iso
image from scratch.

So, do you really need to modify the images? If not, a simple dd:

dd if=/dev/scd0 of=win_xp.iso

will grab the complete image including the boot code.


   Cheers,
   Mike
