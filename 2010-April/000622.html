Good heavens. I didn't even suspect that a power supply could do this
with the safeguards they (are supposed to) have in them.

I generally physically disconnect the backup drives from the system.
Not only does this protect against power supply problems (esp. lightning),
but also helps to protect against hackers, accidents or malicious software
bugs, etc.

Of course, there cannot be any of these serious problems when the drive
is inserted into the system. I often use a standalone boot disk when
doing restores. 
 
&gt;<i> My backup strategy then changed to using external USB drives as the backup
</I>&gt;<i> drives. USB limits current and the converter circuit would most likely
</I>&gt;<i> protect the drive in a bad power situation. But I still was not sleeping
</I>&gt;<i> well at night. So, I purchased a used Primera Composer robotic disk handler
</I>&gt;<i> and wrote the software to control it. Now I can make a full backup and store
</I>&gt;<i> it off site, and every night the software checks to see if it should burn an
</I>&gt;<i> incremental disk. If it does, it emails me and I know to go to the basement
</I>&gt;<i> to pick up the disk to take to offsite storage. Short of a nuclear strike,
</I>&gt;<i> my data is well protected.

This sounds great. If you haven't already you could post about it somewhere
as other people might be interested in it too. ;)


  Cheers,
