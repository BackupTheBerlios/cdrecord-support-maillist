For a simple program like cdparanoia, this is easy to implement. For one 
firection, you just first write a few zero samples into the output file
and then continue with normal operation. For the other direction, it is a bit
more complex but still relatively simple.

Cdda2wav by default puts every track into a separate file for better usability 
of the result. This makes things nuch harder to implement.


&gt;<i> &gt; It is most unlikely that this program will help you. It is based on libcdio
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and libcdio was created from an outdated version of cdda2wav and is even
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I thought it was based on other vcdimager, is the information wrong?:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/software/libcdio/libcdio.html">http://www.gnu.org/software/libcdio/libcdio.html</A>
</I>
The READMEs in the libcdio project explain that it is based on cdda2wav
and it is even possible to identify code that was taken from cdda2wav.
Cdda2wav from 1993 up to April 2006 was under GPLv2 _only_ and newer releases
are under CDDL. It is not possible to relicense the code under GPLv2 &quot;or any
later&quot; or even GPLv3.

Cdparanoia is based on a cdda2wav version from 1987. Even vcdimager
is based on code from cdrtools and vcdimater (similar to libcdio) is in 
license violations with the code taken from cdrtools. Vcdimager did take code
from cdrtools that was not published under GPL and but claims it is under GPL.
The author of the related code did never give permission to put this code under 
GPL.

It is unfortunate to see tha in special the &quot;Free software foundation&quot; did 
take a lot of code from cdrtools but does not honor it's licens and the 
Copyright law.


&gt;<i> I like the attention to features and quality in cdrtools, and also portability.
</I>
I am writing OpenSource Software since 1982 and an important feature of OSS 
code from the early times was the ability to use the code on any platform.
I am still following this goal. If you do a reality check, you will find that 
e.g. GNOME is used on many platforms but unfortunately many authors for GNOME
sub projects only case about their home platform resulting in non-prtable code.
This is something that harms the OSS community...


&gt;<i> &gt; Note that the typical audio read offset is less than 20ms and you will need to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; create a 20th or 50th stage copy in order to be able to notice the offset at
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; all.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Very true, it's not noticeable by the ears. I am also interested in
</I>&gt;<i> checksumming the audio data to compare with others on a 3rd party
</I>&gt;<i> database. This requires a reference for zero (or, the first sample),
</I>&gt;<i> and is most consistent if the audio output by the extractor program
</I>&gt;<i> (i.e. cued / cdparanoia / cdda2wav) is aligned to &quot;zero&quot;. Zero can be
</I>&gt;<i> anything but it does differ between drives. It is simplest from the
</I>&gt;<i> view of a checksumming process to have the data aligned instead of
</I>&gt;<i> adding metadata about which drive was used and missing audio samples
</I>&gt;<i> used as data in the checksum.
</I>
What 3rd party data base do you like to use?

If you use cdda2wav paraopts=proof, you will get an optimized set of paranoia 
options and (in contrary to cdparanoia) you will get a summary for every track 
that informs you whether the extraction was successful and without audible 
deviations from the original.

BTW, the idea behind some of the checksum data bases is to avoid paranoia code 
and to only check whether the extraction result is the same as from other users.
