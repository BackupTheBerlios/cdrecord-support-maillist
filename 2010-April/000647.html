I thought it was based on other vcdimager, is the information wrong?:
<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/software/libcdio/libcdio.html">http://www.gnu.org/software/libcdio/libcdio.html</A>

&gt;&gt;<i> Please note this feature request is not intended to spark a discussion

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (reference) anyways?&quot; It is just a feature that I would find useful if

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> important for my uses. I am surprised that a sample offset
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> compensation read feature does not appear to be implemented already in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cdrtools.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, the features in cdda2wav are oriented on importance and offset correction
</I>&gt;<i> is a task of low importance if you think of general audio extraction quality
</I>&gt;<i> and if you look at the ability to extrace meta data from or for audio CDs.
</I>&gt;<i> With general audio extraction quality, cdda2wav is one of the very best
</I>&gt;<i> programs and e.g. better than cdparanoia. Cdda2wav reads many audio CDs
</I>&gt;<i> without problems that cannot be read using cdparanoia at all.
</I>
I like the attention to features and quality in cdrtools, and also portability.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The next planned feature for cdda2wav is the ability to detect stable incorrect
</I>&gt;<i> audio data and after that, offset correction is planned.
</I>
Glad to hear that! This answers my question / request about offset
correction appearing in cdrtools.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Note that the typical audio read offset is less than 20ms and you will need to
</I>&gt;<i> create a 20th or 50th stage copy in order to be able to notice the offset at
</I>&gt;<i> all.
</I>
Very true, it's not noticeable by the ears. I am also interested in
checksumming the audio data to compare with others on a 3rd party
database. This requires a reference for zero (or, the first sample),
and is most consistent if the audio output by the extractor program
(i.e. cued / cdparanoia / cdda2wav) is aligned to &quot;zero&quot;. Zero can be
anything but it does differ between drives. It is simplest from the
view of a checksumming process to have the data aligned instead of
adding metadata about which drive was used and missing audio samples
used as data in the checksum.

Thanks for addressing my questions.
