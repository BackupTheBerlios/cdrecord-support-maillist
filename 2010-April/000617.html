<PRE> Mike,

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;Do let us know what you come up with here. I'm sure a lot of people
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;will be interested to know the result. I will search some more and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;let you know if I find something that might help. If we can't find an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;answer, I think a post to the kernel mailing list is in order.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I will do just that if I find that the new kernel does not fix this problem.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;60 DVDs! That's almost 300GB. I have been using a removable HD &gt;rack
</I>&gt;<i> system for backup purposes, and using DVDs for data that
</I>
   &gt; needs to be duped/shared/stored at different locations. A 500GB
   &gt; SATA drive can be had in the $50 range and at that price, a second
   &gt;  backup can be justified if the data is critical.

This was very similar to my backup strategy. I placed pairs of data drives
in my file server and used rdiff-backup to backup the data from one to the
other every night. But one day my power supply failed and dumped line
voltage out the 5 and 12 volt lines. In less than a tenths of a second, I
had lost every disk drive in the system. Along with mother board, fans, ...
The only thing to survive was a 3+1/2 floppy drive!

My backup strategy then changed to using external USB drives as the backup
drives. USB limits current and the converter circuit would most likely
protect the drive in a bad power situation. But I still was not sleeping
well at night. So, I purchased a used Primera Composer robotic disk handler
and wrote the software to control it. Now I can make a full backup and store
it off site, and every night the software checks to see if it should burn an
incremental disk. If it does, it emails me and I know to go to the basement
to pick up the disk to take to offsite storage. Short of a nuclear strike,
my data is well protected.


&gt;<i>I recommend to use at least -iso-level 3 as this is the minimal level &gt;that
</I>gives you large file suppoort.
&gt;<i>Unless you like to use the medium on systems that have problems with Rock
</I>Ridge,
&gt;<i>it does not make sense to use options like -ldots -allow-lowercase
</I>&gt;<i>-allow-multidot -relaxed-filenames
</I>&gt;<i>The option -D was needed in former times as there have been bugs in
</I>&gt;<i>mkisofs that prevented correct deep directory relocation with Rock
</I>&gt;<i> Ridge. This was fixed in August 2006. There is absolutely no need to
</I>&gt;<i> still use this option.
</I>
I changed the iso level to 3 and removed the -D and the -ldots
-allow-lowercase -allow-multidot -relaxed-filenames options. I burned a disk
and on the Linux box the disk is identical to the source. Yea! I then move
this disk to a Windows machine, and the file names are different. They all
appear in upper case and have been mangled to match the Windows file
standard.

Since I only care to use these disks to restore a Linux computer should I
care that the disk appear different on a Windows box? With the -ldots...
options the disk appeared the same on Linux and Windows.

So much to learn... Is there a good reference to Jolliet/RockRidge formats
that would let me understand this issue better?

-Skye
