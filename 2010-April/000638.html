Joerg,
   You are correct. Nothing stops me from reading the man page. I
completely agree.

   This isn't at all about adding verbage. My point is that there's
already too much in the man pages. It's about making sure the verbage
that exists is as effective for non-professional, non-programmer, user
types as possible.

   Respectfully, you will likely NEVER truly understand this issue
experiencially. You are far to close to the program with far too much
experience. You can probably do 99% of your tasks without ever looking
at the man page. You know how DVDs and CDs work physically. You know
multiple revisions of the specs. It's all far too obvious for you to
actually have these problems.

   Try to understand, if only conceptually, what happens when a 12
year old wants to copy an audio CD. When an 8 year old wants to burn a
game he's downloaded. These man pages make no difference to those
people and the examples aren't clearly oriented to the exact tasks for
them to see the answers. You probably won't remember but a couple of
months ago I wanted to copy a multi-media CD - 7 songs and a video. I
NEVER got that working. I read the man pages. Nothing ever solved the
problem. I gave up.

    Again, I think the program is wonderful, and I've never for a
second ever thought I was looking at a bug anytime I ever used it.
It's always been about my being unable to find the clues about how to
unlock the program and get it to do what I need. You will NEVER have
that experience.

- Mark
