I assume you mean either of the -raw96? options.  I tried both raw96p 
and raw96r.  With both, I get a &quot;Drive does not support RAW recording&quot; 
error as shown below.

I also had issues attempting to burn to a BD-R as shown below.  Even 
though I stipulated &quot;-dummy&quot; it still wrote some data to the disc (coaster).

I've had no issues with CD and DVD writes with the drive but I'm et to 
have any success with Bluray.

Thanks
