<PRE>Hi all,

I'm trying to use a Panasonic SW-5582C and the actual cdrecord release
for burning large UDF images (30-40GB).
Burning of media fails in 9 of 10 tries, in dummy mode as in real mode too.

The abort occurs sometimes quick, sometimes half way through the image
file of 33 GB.
One burn process has been successfull (using 1x speed) but this was not
reproducable.
The error seems to be the same everytime (see the appended logs).

I'm trying Solaris Sparc and Linux x86, both show similar behaviour (vol
management was switched off on Solaris)

Sunn uname -r gives SunOS xxx 5.9 Generic_122300-35 sun4u sparc
SUNW,Sun-Fire-V440
Linux was 2.6.18 Debian

Has anybody used this drive successfully with cdrecord?
I tried Panasonic media and Sony media (manufacturer is Panasonic) which
were recommended for this drive by the distributor,
I've ordered Verbatim, maybe they perform better.

Do you have any suggestions what I am doing wrong?

Thanks in advance,
Mark
