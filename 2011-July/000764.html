<PRE>Thanks for the quick reply. I am glad to hear about a &quot;bootstrap&quot; smake.
Unfortunately I do not seem to have access to the /pub directory on
ftp.berlios.de . Is anonymous login not sufficient?
When I open the link you gave in you reply in a browser (Seamonkey
2.0.14 in Mac OSX or Firefox 3.6.18, Mac OSX) simply nothing happens.
It would say &quot;Loading&quot; and show a busy sign, but nothing else would
happen. When I use a dedicated FTP client such as FileZilla or gFTP
I can connect to ftp.berlios.de (&quot;anonymous&quot; + random email address)
but when trying to change into the &quot;/pub&quot; directory I get a connection
timeout.
I already experienced this behaviour when trying to download the
cdrtools sources a few days ago. I found them as src rpm package on a
Linux distribution site.

Best regards,

Johannes

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> After some time I am again trying to compile cdrtools for the Windows

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> problems with mounting paths with the Cygwin version and the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> additional dependancy on the Cygwin dlls.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I downloaded the latest version (cdrtools 3.01a05). Unpacking the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> source tarball went without problems; last time I tried I had lots
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of trouble even with that. I read the README.mingw32 file which says
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well GNUtar has strange bugs. Some of them have been fixed partly 2 years ago.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you are a victim of GNU tar and cannot succeed to unpack archives, there are
</I>&gt;<i> shell archives from smake and star.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that I need MinGW in a specific version and MSYS in a specific version.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I downloaded and installed those (actually I already had MinGW). Then
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it says I should adjust the Path varible, which I did accordingly. The
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> final step should simply be running `make? and that's it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It seems that you used gmake which is known to fail on MinGW. I recommend to
</I>&gt;<i> use smake that was in use aprox. 7-10 years ago when I was working wwith the
</I>&gt;<i> last person who helped to make cdrtools compile on MinGW.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> During make a few problems arose though, some are minor and easy to fix
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> some are more basic and would require more understanding of what is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> really required.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1) in the rules files RULES/i?86-mingw32_nt-gcc.rul the library mgw32
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      is added to the linker options (-lmgw32). On my system there no
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      libmgw32.a file but rather a libmingw32.a. I do not know what this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      library does and why it is needed but replacing mgw32 by mingw32
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      succeeds in building the programs  align_test.exe and avoffset.exe
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      which in turn results in generating the otherwise missing files
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      align.h and avoffset.h.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As I believe that I repeated the port at home, I am sure there was such a
</I>&gt;<i> library at that time. You seem to miss functions that are otherwise granted to
</I>&gt;<i> exist. This seems to be a hint that something may be missing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2) In libschily/fexec.c the macro `fd_getfd? is incorrectly defined
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      if the macro F_GETFD is not defined (lines 138 - 142). This leads
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      to compile errors in lines 370, 376, 382.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      I set it to                  `#define fd_getfd(fd)  fd?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      Likewise I set fd_setfd() to `#define df_setfd(fd, val)  fd=val?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      (not yet done in the attached build log).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> These macros need to return 0 in case that fcntl() is not available.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3) Changing line 64 of include/schily/ccomdefs.h from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>        #if __GNUC__&gt;  3 || __GNUC__ == 3&amp;&amp;  __GNUC_MINOR__&gt;  1
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>        #if (__GNUC__&gt;  3 || (__GNUC__ == 3&amp;&amp;  __GNUC_MINOR__&gt;  1))&amp;&amp;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> !defined WIN32
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      helped avoiding a lot of warnings `ignoring attribute __used__?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      (or similar). Obviously, although the MinGW gcc I am using (MinGW
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      distribution 3.1.0-1 as requested in README.mingw32) is version
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      3.2.3 it does not support the __used__ attribute as apparently
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      his brothers on other OSs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It may be that you see a well known bug in newer GCCs. This does not seem to be
</I>&gt;<i> MinGW specific. GCC unfortunately prints a warning message even if there is
</I>&gt;<i> code that is 100% correct according to the C-standard. An example:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 	(void) write(2, &quot;ERROR\n&quot;, 6);
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> is not permitted to cause a copiler warning.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> These were the minor ones, now to the more severe problems:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 4) A number of *nix system calls regarding file/process ownership,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      such as getuid(), geteuid(), etc., are not found and therefore
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      linking fails (btcflash.exe, mkisofs.exe, readcd.exe,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      scgskeleton.exe)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am not aware that there ever have been related problems. You seem to miss a
</I>&gt;<i> library.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      I have code for some of these calls but not for setuid().
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 5) The same goes for the gettimeofday() system call. I do have code
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      for this, too, but again the build system should have warned about
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is very strange that gettimeofday() is missing.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 6) More errors from the build log:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> make[1]: Entering directory `/d/WINPROG/cdrtools-3.01/cdda2wav'
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ../RULES/local.cnf:43: OBJ/i686-mingw32_nt-gcc/Inull: No such file or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> directory
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ../RULES/local.cnf:44: OBJ/i686-mingw32_nt-gcc/local.cnf: No such file
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or directory
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>           ==&gt;  MAKING DIRECTORY &quot;OBJ/i686-mingw32_nt-gcc&quot;

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>           ==&gt;  MAKING DEPENDENCIES &quot;OBJ/i686-mingw32_nt-gcc/base64.d&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In file included from base64.c:2:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> config.h:34:21: lconfig.h: No such file or directory
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is most likely a result from a well known bug in GNU make.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> GNUmake has a rotten parser that causes problems on platforms that use \r\n as
</I>&gt;<i> line end and \ ad path name separator.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It is recommended to use smake on such platforms.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Did you try:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 	<A HREF="ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/schily/">ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/schily/</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is a bootstrap smake inside that compiles with shell scripts only and
</I>&gt;<i> does not rely on a non-existent make program.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sndconfig.c: In function `init_soundcard':

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sndconfig.c:345: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sndconfig.c:345: for each function it appears in.)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> make[1]: *** [OBJ/i686-mingw32_nt-gcc/sndconfig.o] Error 1
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> looks like a followup problem from the problem above.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    ==&gt;  COMPILING &quot;OBJ/i686-mingw32_nt-gcc/cdrecord.o&quot;

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> make[1]: *** [OBJ/i686-mingw32_nt-gcc/cdrecord.o] Error 1
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This function exists since y2000 and may have been introduced past the last

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I was under the assumption that an OS either supports select() or poll() as
</I>&gt;<i> this seems to be true since aprox. 1984.
