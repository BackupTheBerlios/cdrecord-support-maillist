<PRE>I make small steps forward. Quoting the cmd in single quotes before
the spanwl() call is the key. Subsequently I had to change the single
quotes to double quotes in the &quot;sed .... &quot; lines in RULES/r-smake.dep.
I do not know whether this breaks the process on a different platform.
This has to be investigated.
The problem I am currently trying to find is that the implicit O macro
(capital letter 'O') is not always defined to the value of .OBJDIR
but rather to the default &quot;.&quot;
Thus the object files after compilation end up in the same directory
as the source files and thus linking fails. I have attached several
logs with different -d and -D options running ../psmake/smake -f 
align_test.mk from within inc.
I am not sure when .OBJDIR during the smake run is set (it is assigned
in RULES/r-smake.obj) and when this is transferred to O, which is then
referred in RULES/r-smake.obj
At this point it is totally unclear why this behaves differently on
MinGW but I am sure there is a simple explanation, once you know..
Any hint where to look?

Best regards,

Johannes
