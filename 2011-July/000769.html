<PRE>/*--------------------------------------------------------------------------*/
Some new information:

I have been able to find the patches from the russion guy who did make the last
MinGW port in 2003. His code is very expensive, he implements many things by 
hand that are already available in the port abstraction system in a more 
generalized form.

There are however a log of hints that could be used to create a new better port.

Basic information in any case:

You first need to port smake to mingw.

Do this by downloading:

<A HREF="ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/schily/schily-2011-05-08.tar.bz2">ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/schily/schily-2011-05-08.tar.bz2</A>

and unpacking the archive.

Then chdir to the  directory &quot;psmake&quot; and call &quot;./MAKE-all&quot; in that directory.
This works completely shell skript controlled. If there are basic problems 
with compiling smake, we first need to address them but the changes will 
immediately help cdrtools to advance as everything uses a unique portability 
system.

With smake I mainly expect problems with calling shell commands.

Repeating things as they have not made it to the list

As I try to avoid to use a Microsoft environment, and as I have too few 
experiences with MinGW, I am just able to help with reports from people who 
actually try. Given the fact that I need to make sure that my software will be 
able to survive me, there should be other people who collaborate with the 
development ;-)

&gt;<i>From other porting attempts, it seems to be the best idea if someone who is

the basic code structure is higly portable, it usually takes less than one 
hour to fix problems with a specific platform.


There is a russian guy who offered older versions from cdrtools as MinGW based 
binaries, but he unfortunately did not report what he did in order to succeed.

There is MS SFU (Interix) or whatever it is called today. Cdrtools compile 
in this environment, but unfortunately MS does not offer access to the SCSI 
subsystem to programs that are run in that environment.

There is also UWIN and from a discussion I had with David Korn, there is a big 
chance to get cdrtools compile and work on UWIN - I did not try yet.


&gt;<i> You need to follow Schilling's recommendations to use his smake at the very
</I>&gt;<i> least.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At one point Gnu Make used to work on Cygwin. About 3 years ago, it quit.
</I>&gt;<i> Using smake became a requirment.
</I>
Gmake always has been a problem. Gmake compiles on many platforms but it works 
in a suffuciently usable way only on very few platforms. Even though smake is 
much older than gmake, I planned to stop working on smake around 1995. 

When the OS/2 port was made for cdrtools in 1998, it turned out that the 
person in Russia who initially worked on the port spend more than two weeks 
without being able to advance. After he presented really strange results, I 
made the proposal to first port smake. He was confused and thought that this 
would force him to work for many additional weeks without being able to 
advance the cdrtools port. After I have been able to convince him to try to 
compile smake once, it turned out that porting smake to OS/2 took less than a 
day and most of the problems he observed before while trying to use gmake 
disappeared while using smake. 

After seeing this experience, It was obvious that I need to continue working on 
smake if I like to support more than a few target platforms.

If you like to understans why gmake has problems on other platforms, have a 
look in the source and check how many platform specific #ifdefs are in the 
makefile parser. Smake has no such #ifdefs and this avoids platform specific 
problems. If you like to port smake, you only need to find a way to call a 
halfway POSIX compliant shell and to add code to smake/archconf.c to enable the 
automake features for the new platform (this is code like uname() for 
auto-detecting platforms).


&gt;<i> And I've found that only the 3.xx gcc compilers to have been successful in
</I>&gt;<i> compiling on Cygwin for cdrtools. You should take note that the versions of
</I>&gt;<i> cdrtools that appear on the net for Windows use a Cygwin compiled version of
</I>&gt;<i> cdrtools.
</I>
As mentioned before, GCC-4.x gives warnings on 100% ANSI-C compliant code.
Warnings like:

        ==&gt; COMPILING &quot;raisecond.o&quot; 
raisecond.c: In function 'raiseabort': 
raisecond.c:159: warning: ignoring return value of 'write', declared with attribute warn_unused_result 

Are printed because GCC-4 ignores ANSI C rules that permit to write something 
like:

	(void) write(2, &quot;ERROR\n&quot;, 6);

in order to tell the compiler that the return value from write() is 
intentionally ignored.
