Well GNUtar has strange bugs. Some of them have been fixed partly 2 years ago.

If you are a victim of GNU tar and cannot succeed to unpack archives, there are 
shell archives from smake and star.

It seems that you used gmake which is known to fail on MinGW. I recommend to 
use smake that was in use aprox. 7-10 years ago when I was working wwith the 
last person who helped to make cdrtools compile on MinGW.

&gt;<i> During make a few problems arose though, some are minor and easy to fix
</I>&gt;<i> some are more basic and would require more understanding of what is
</I>&gt;<i> really required.
</I>&gt;<i> 1) in the rules files RULES/i?86-mingw32_nt-gcc.rul the library mgw32
</I>&gt;<i>     is added to the linker options (-lmgw32). On my system there no
</I>&gt;<i>     libmgw32.a file but rather a libmingw32.a. I do not know what this
</I>&gt;<i>     library does and why it is needed but replacing mgw32 by mingw32
</I>&gt;<i>     succeeds in building the programs  align_test.exe and avoffset.exe
</I>&gt;<i>     which in turn results in generating the otherwise missing files
</I>&gt;<i>     align.h and avoffset.h.
</I>
As I believe that I repeated the port at home, I am sure there was such a 
library at that time. You seem to miss functions that are otherwise granted to 
exist. This seems to be a hint that something may be missing.

&gt;<i> 2) In libschily/fexec.c the macro `fd_getfd? is incorrectly defined
</I>&gt;<i>     if the macro F_GETFD is not defined (lines 138 - 142). This leads
</I>&gt;<i>     to compile errors in lines 370, 376, 382.
</I>&gt;<i>     I set it to                  `#define fd_getfd(fd)  fd?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Likewise I set fd_setfd() to `#define df_setfd(fd, val)  fd=val?
</I>&gt;<i>     (not yet done in the attached build log).
</I>
These macros need to return 0 in case that fcntl() is not available.

&gt;<i> 3) Changing line 64 of include/schily/ccomdefs.h from
</I>&gt;<i>       #if __GNUC__ &gt; 3 || __GNUC__ == 3 &amp;&amp; __GNUC_MINOR__ &gt; 1
</I>&gt;<i>     to
</I>&gt;<i>       #if (__GNUC__ &gt; 3 || (__GNUC__ == 3 &amp;&amp; __GNUC_MINOR__ &gt; 1)) &amp;&amp; 
</I>&gt;<i> !defined WIN32
</I>&gt;<i>     helped avoiding a lot of warnings `ignoring attribute __used__?
</I>&gt;<i>     (or similar). Obviously, although the MinGW gcc I am using (MinGW
</I>&gt;<i>     distribution 3.1.0-1 as requested in README.mingw32) is version
</I>&gt;<i>     3.2.3 it does not support the __used__ attribute as apparently
</I>&gt;<i>     his brothers on other OSs.
</I>
It may be that you see a well known bug in newer GCCs. This does not seem to be 
MinGW specific. GCC unfortunately prints a warning message even if there is 
code that is 100% correct according to the C-standard. An example: 

	(void) write(2, &quot;ERROR\n&quot;, 6);

is not permitted to cause a copiler warning.

&gt;<i> These were the minor ones, now to the more severe problems:
</I>&gt;<i> 4) A number of *nix system calls regarding file/process ownership,
</I>&gt;<i>     such as getuid(), geteuid(), etc., are not found and therefore
</I>&gt;<i>     linking fails (btcflash.exe, mkisofs.exe, readcd.exe,
</I>&gt;<i>     scgskeleton.exe)
</I>
I am not aware that there ever have been related problems. You seem to miss a 
library.

&gt;<i>     I have code for some of these calls but not for setuid().
</I>
&gt;<i> 5) The same goes for the gettimeofday() system call. I do have code
</I>&gt;<i>     for this, too, but again the build system should have warned about
</I>&gt;<i>     it.
</I>
It is very strange that gettimeofday() is missing.

&gt;<i> 6) More errors from the build log:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> make[1]: Entering directory `/d/WINPROG/cdrtools-3.01/cdda2wav'
</I>&gt;<i> ../RULES/local.cnf:43: OBJ/i686-mingw32_nt-gcc/Inull: No such file or 
</I>&gt;<i> directory
</I>&gt;<i> ../RULES/local.cnf:44: OBJ/i686-mingw32_nt-gcc/local.cnf: No such file 
</I>&gt;<i> or directory
</I>&gt;<i>          ==&gt; MAKING DIRECTORY &quot;OBJ/i686-mingw32_nt-gcc&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>          ==&gt; MAKING DEPENDENCIES &quot;OBJ/i686-mingw32_nt-gcc/parse.d&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>          ==&gt; MAKING DEPENDENCIES &quot;OBJ/i686-mingw32_nt-gcc/base64.d&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> In file included from base64.c:2:
</I>&gt;<i> config.h:34:21: lconfig.h: No such file or directory
</I>
This is most likely a result from a well known bug in GNU make.

GNUmake has a rotten parser that causes problems on platforms that use \r\n as 
line end and \ ad path name separator.

It is recommended to use smake on such platforms.

Did you try:

	<A HREF="ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/schily/">ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/schily/</A>

There is a bootstrap smake inside that compiles with shell scripts only and 
does not rely on a non-existent make program.

&gt;<i> sndconfig.c: In function `init_soundcard':
</I>&gt;<i> sndconfig.c:345: `WIN_CallBack' undeclared (first use in this function)
</I>&gt;<i> sndconfig.c:345: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
</I>&gt;<i> sndconfig.c:345: for each function it appears in.)
</I>&gt;<i> make[1]: *** [OBJ/i686-mingw32_nt-gcc/sndconfig.o] Error 1
</I>
looks like a followup problem from the problem above.

&gt;<i>   ==&gt; COMPILING &quot;OBJ/i686-mingw32_nt-gcc/cdrecord.o&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> cdrecord.c:5091:28: stropts.h: No such file or directory
</I>&gt;<i> cdrecord.c:5092:25: poll.h: No such file or directory
</I>&gt;<i> cdrecord.c: In function `wait_input':
</I>&gt;<i> cdrecord.c:5107: storage size of `pfd' isn't known
</I>&gt;<i> cdrecord.c:5117: `POLLIN' undeclared (first use in this function)
</I>&gt;<i> cdrecord.c:5117: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
</I>&gt;<i> cdrecord.c:5117: for each function it appears in.)
</I>&gt;<i> make[1]: *** [OBJ/i686-mingw32_nt-gcc/cdrecord.o] Error 1
</I>
This function exists since y2000 and may have been introduced past the last 
MinGW port has been made.

I was under the assumption that an OS either supports select() or poll() as 
this seems to be true since aprox. 1984.

Let us delay the other problems until you have a working smake and until you 
found a solution for the missing functions from libc.
