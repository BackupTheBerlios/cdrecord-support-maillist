<PRE>I am sorry for not coming back for a while. I had a hard disc failure
on my main computer and it took me soome time to recover with fragments
of the damaged disk and the latest backup.
---
Now I took on again the task of building the cdrtools under MS Windows
using MinGW/MSYS. I saw that there is a new SW distribution
&quot;schily-2011-07-26&quot;. I downloaded it and tried to build it. Here are my
results and findings:
* I have applied similar changes to smake/make.c as I did when compiling
   smake-1.2.1

* add &quot;test -h ...&quot; in psmake/MAKE-sh (as previously discussed)

* replace the single quotes qith double quotes in RULES/r-smake.dep
   (as previously discussed)

* replace $O/$@ with $(ARCHDIR)/$@ in RULES/r-smake-obj (as discussed
   before)
   I did not yet explore this issue furthere, why $O sometimes is not
   set correctly. Although I think this can be resolved I wanted to go
   ahead with the overall building process.

* libschily/searchinpath.c is unchanged from schily-dist-pre5 so the
   issue is still the same that it does not find sh.exe.

These issues are already known and under investigation (I hope). The
following are new (for me):

* in include/schily/libport.h the getgr..() functions are declared
   errornously; they should be of the type 'struct group *' instead of
   'struct passwd *' - a copy/paste error

* in include/schily/mconfig.h the definitions for PATH_DELIM... are
   for a MinGW in a separate #ifdef - section. But in line 83 IS_UNIX
   gets defined for MinGW, too. Thus there are some &quot;redefined macro&quot;
   warnings are produced by the compiler. I suggest to add a check for
   __MINGW32__ in line 82, similar to __DJGPP__. The resulting paragraph
   would be then:
#ifndef IS_UNIX
# if (defined(unix) || defined(__unix) || defined(__unix__)) &amp;&amp; \
   !defined(__DJGPP__) &amp;&amp; !defined(__MINGW32__)
#   define  IS_UNIX
# endif
#endif
   I do not know whether the IS_UNIX macro does have impact on
   conditional code in other files.

* missing header files: pwd.h, grp.h, sys/utsname.h, sys/times.h

* mkdir(): under Unix mkdir() takes two parameters, the directory name
   and the permissions. Under DOS/Windows it has only one parameter, the
   directory name. Could this be handled by the autoconf system?

* missing system calls/library functions: pipe(), fork(), wait(),
   mkstemp(). These produce linker errors for several programs.

* missing macros/constants: SIGHUP, SIGPIPE, SIGQUIT, SIGALARM, SIGKILL.
   Maybe related to pipe(), fork(), wait()?

* missing macro S_IFLNK: MinGW is not aware of links (this is in
   contrast to Cygwin). S_IFLNK is used in sccs/sccs/cmd/src/diff.c;
   it is used in other locations, too, but there is where the compiling
   problem occurs. My suggestion is to guard the S_IFLNK case with an
   #ifdef S_IFLNK condition, like it is done in libfind/find_list.c

* missing macro F_GETFD: this is used in scgcheck/scgcheck.c. A
   solution could be to define it, if not already defined, to 0, or
   introduce another macro similar to libschily/fexec.c. Or a more
   general solution in a header file created by autoconf.

* &quot;illegal macro definition 'i386-mingw32_nt-gcc' in MAKEFLAGS&quot;. This
   is a message produce by smake. I had this already when compiling the
   final smake using the bootstrap smake within smake-1.2.1. I
   investigated it a little but not in depth when I saw it happens in the
   deep of smake. The compilation process was only affected slightly
   since it happend only in building the man pages. I do not know how
   we continue on this issue.

Questions:
* How can I create a cdrtools package out of the complete Schily
   distribution? Some of the problems are within programs that I am not
   interested in.

* Did you check the searchfileinpath() function?


I have attached a build log.


Best regards,

Johannes
