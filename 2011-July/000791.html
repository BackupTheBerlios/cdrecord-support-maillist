<PRE>Partly Success!

I am able to compile smake under the MinGW environment. Based on
version smake-1.2.1 with following changes the build process is
successful:
- in RULES/i?86-mingw32_nt-gcc.rul:
   replace -lmgw32 with -lmingw32 (as discussed previously)
- in psmake/MAKE-sh:
   add line test -h xxzzy.123 || lnfiles=&quot;sh cpfiles&quot; after the line
   test -r xxzzy.123 || lnfiles=&quot;sh cpfiles&quot;
   (as discussed previously)
- in RULES/r-smake.dep:
   replace the single quotes with double quotes in the sed ... lines
   (as mentioned earlier)
- in RULES/r-smake.obj:
   replace -o O/$@ with -o $(ARCHDSIR)/$@ in line45
- in include/schily/ccomdefs.h:
   add a check !defined __MINGW32__ to the conditional definition of
   macro UConst so that Uconst will be defined to const
   (as discussed previously)
   Note: this is not strictly necessary but prevents the generation of
     a lot of warnings.
- in smake/make.c:
   in docmd():
   - add a sectionfor __MINGW32__
   - quote the command which shall be executed in sh with single quotes
   - call spawnl()

I have attached an archive of the changed files.
Unfortunately I only discovered when trying to build 'schily-dist' (and
this did not work) that the files in smake-1.2.1 are very different from
within schily-dist-pre5. Applying similar changes is not sufficient for
producing a working smake from schily-dist-pre5... So there is still a
lot to do.

I am currently trying to build the cdrtools package with my brandnew
smake. I get still errors. More information will follow.

Best regards,

Johannes
