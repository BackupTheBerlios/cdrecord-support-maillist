<PRE>I tried to compile smake (from /pub/smake/smake-1.2.1.shar.gz) but had
no success so far. It would compile the bootstrap smake ok but compiling
the final smake using the bootstrap smake fails.

Here are the error messages. I think it has something to do with the
internal 'echo' command of cmd.exe. In RULES/rules1.top it says:
   @echo &gt; $@ (line 259)
I am not sure what this is supposed to do; under my setup it ends up
with something like &quot;ECHO ist eingeschaltet (ON).&quot; in file incs/Dnull.

./psmake/smake -r all
d:\WINPROG\smake-1.2.1\psmake\smake.exe: Found illegal option '--unix' 
in MAKEFLAGS.
d:\WINPROG\smake-1.2.1\psmake\smake.exe: Ignoring illegal option '--unix'.
d:\WINPROG\smake-1.2.1\psmake\smake.exe: Objcount: 4 Objects: 'ECHO' 
'ist' 'eingeschaltet' '(ON).'
d:\WINPROG\smake-1.2.1\psmake\smake.exe: Missing : or =, got '
' &lt;12&gt; in line 2 col 0 of 'incs/Dnull'
d:\WINPROG\smake-1.2.1\psmake\smake.exe: Bad syntax in 'incs/Dnull'.

While I am typing this I try compiling the version you suggested in
your last mail. BTW I still have problems with the FTP server. I
investigated this a little with the cmdline ftp client. I can connect
can 'cd' into dirctories, can do 'pwd'. But I cannot do 'ls', 'get'
or similar. I can download files with the 'wget' utility. But for
this I have to know the excdat name and location of the file I want
to download. I did not notice problems with FTP with other sites. -
Strange.

For making the compilation of the bootstrap smake work I had to change
in psmake/lnfiles: there are a number of header fils which are to be
copied/linked to another location. I had to remove the ../../ part
of the path (lines 38 - 76).

I am willing to make this MinGW port work, but I need help...

</I>&gt;<i> generalized form.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are however a log of hints that could be used to create a new better port.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Basic information in any case:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You first need to port smake to mingw.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Do this by downloading:

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> and unpacking the archive.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then chdir to the  directory &quot;psmake&quot; and call &quot;./MAKE-all&quot; in that directory.

</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I have never succeeded in compiling cdrtools on MinGW. Have tried on and

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> environment on windows that has worked for me.

</I>&gt;<i> As I try to avoid to use a Microsoft environment, and as I have too few

</I>&gt;<i> able to survive me, there should be other people who collaborate with the
</I>&gt;<i> development ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> From other porting attempts, it seems to be the best idea if someone who is
</I>&gt;<i> used to  work under MinGW would do some testing and reports his results. As
</I>&gt;<i> the basic code structure is higly portable, it usually takes less than one
</I>&gt;<i> hour to fix problems with a specific platform.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is a russian guy who offered older versions from cdrtools as MinGW based
</I>&gt;<i> binaries, but he unfortunately did not report what he did in order to succeed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is MS SFU (Interix) or whatever it is called today. Cdrtools compile
</I>&gt;<i> in this environment, but unfortunately MS does not offer access to the SCSI
</I>&gt;<i> subsystem to programs that are run in that environment.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There is also UWIN and from a discussion I had with David Korn, there is a big
</I>&gt;<i> chance to get cdrtools compile and work on UWIN - I did not try yet.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> You need to follow Schilling's recommendations to use his smake at the very
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> least.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> At one point Gnu Make used to work on Cygwin. About 3 years ago, it quit.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Using smake became a requirment.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Gmake always has been a problem. Gmake compiles on many platforms but it works
</I>&gt;<i> in a suffuciently usable way only on very few platforms. Even though smake is
</I>&gt;<i> much older than gmake, I planned to stop working on smake around 1995.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When the OS/2 port was made for cdrtools in 1998, it turned out that the
</I>&gt;<i> person in Russia who initially worked on the port spend more than two weeks
</I>&gt;<i> without being able to advance. After he presented really strange results, I
</I>&gt;<i> made the proposal to first port smake. He was confused and thought that this
</I>&gt;<i> would force him to work for many additional weeks without being able to
</I>&gt;<i> advance the cdrtools port. After I have been able to convince him to try to
</I>&gt;<i> compile smake once, it turned out that porting smake to OS/2 took less than a
</I>&gt;<i> day and most of the problems he observed before while trying to use gmake
</I>&gt;<i> disappeared while using smake.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> After seeing this experience, It was obvious that I need to continue working on
</I>&gt;<i> smake if I like to support more than a few target platforms.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you like to understans why gmake has problems on other platforms, have a
</I>&gt;<i> look in the source and check how many platform specific #ifdefs are in the
</I>&gt;<i> makefile parser. Smake has no such #ifdefs and this avoids platform specific
</I>&gt;<i> problems. If you like to port smake, you only need to find a way to call a
</I>&gt;<i> halfway POSIX compliant shell and to add code to smake/archconf.c to enable the
</I>&gt;<i> automake features for the new platform (this is code like uname() for
</I>&gt;<i> auto-detecting platforms).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> And I've found that only the 3.xx gcc compilers to have been successful in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> compiling on Cygwin for cdrtools. You should take note that the versions of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cdrtools that appear on the net for Windows use a Cygwin compiled version of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cdrtools.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As mentioned before, GCC-4.x gives warnings on 100% ANSI-C compliant code.
</I>&gt;<i> Warnings like:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>          ==&gt;  COMPILING &quot;raisecond.o&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> raisecond.c: In function 'raiseabort':
</I>&gt;<i> raisecond.c:159: warning: ignoring return value of 'write', declared with attribute warn_unused_result
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Are printed because GCC-4 ignores ANSI C rules that permit to write something
</I>&gt;<i> like:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 	(void) write(2, &quot;ERROR\n&quot;, 6);
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> in order to tell the compiler that the return value from write() is
</I>&gt;<i> intentionally ignored.
</I>&gt;<i>
