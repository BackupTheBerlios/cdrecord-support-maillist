<PRE> &gt; BTW: It seems that you ask and send only information that you believe
 &gt; is important. I am still waiting for a lot of information I asked for
I am sorry, but I must have missed that you are waiting for information
from me. I went throught the mails once more but could not find anything
specific. Maybe I missed some mails (victim of spam filters?). So
please tell me once more and explicitely what are the pieces of
information you are waiting for?

I am trying to document my progress and findings openly. I have to
admit that these tend to be seen from my point of view. I am lacking
somewhat the &quot;big picture&quot; and the experience with all of the 30+ 
platforms your software supports. So please be indulgent when I make 
suggestions which are of rather limited scope and would likely break
other platforms.

 &gt; If it does not work, what do you see in $MAKE  with smake -r -f 
/dev/null -p
When running psmake/smake -r -f /dev/null -p from the directory
/d/winprog/smake-1.2.1 from within an MSYS shell it says
   MAKE=d:/winprog/smake-1.2.1/psmake/smake.exe
Running psmake/smake -r all from within the MSYS shell works

When running psmake\smake -r -f nul -p from the directory
D:\winprog\smake-1.2.1 from within a Windows cmd.exe shell it says
   MAKE=psmake/smake
.. and this is the case when I have to give the complete absolute path
in order to successfully build smake. This is a minor issue because
there is a workaround. The final smake does not have any problem and
succeeds in building smake.

Running the final smake -r -f nul -p from D:\winprog\smake-1.2.1 from
within a cmd.exe shell yields
   MAKE=smake

I do not know whether this is caused by a broken getcwd(), by calling
getcwd() differently or by the fact that different environments report
different strings in the argv[0] variable of main() (with or without
full path) or by something else.


With best regards,

Johannes
