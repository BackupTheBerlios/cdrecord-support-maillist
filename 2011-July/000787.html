</I>OK. If MinGW is still considered as supported something has to be done
in this area. It does not build the way it is now.

</I>Thank you!

</I>&gt;<i> You did never send the required information, so I am forced to judge from just

</I>I am sorry; I seem to have missed that. Here is the description of my
findings:
In include/schily/ccomdefs.h there is the macro UConst defined.
Depending on GCC version and platform this definition is different.
When GCC is version later than 3.1 the definition looks like this:

#define UConst  __attribute__ ((__used__)) const

Although GCC of the recommended MinGW version is 3.2.3 it seems that it
does not recognize the __used__ attribute. Therefore there are a lot of
warnings produced during the compilation. My suggestion was in order to
prevent these warnings, to add to the check of the GCC version another
check to see whether the used GCC is a MinGW variant. If so the UConst
macro would be defined like for GCC versions 3.1 and earlier or like
for the PPC platform:

#define UConst  const

If my previous suggestion is likely to break successful compilation on
other platforms, which I cannot see at the moment, maybe a better way to
implement the check is similar to the PPC platform by adding these lines
after line 73:

#ifdef __MINGW32__
/*
  * Hack until mingw supports __attribute__ ((__used__))
  */
#ifdef UConst
#undef UConst
#endif
#define UConst const
#endif  /* __MINGW32__ */

I am sorry to have upset you with this issue.

Best regards,

Johannes
