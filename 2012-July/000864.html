</I>&gt;<i> Thank you for your answer.
</I>&gt;<i> During my tests and searches before reporting, I wasn't able to find anything about the bug (except users not knowing why the resulting ISO images were incompatible). Do you mean this was an already-known bug?
</I>
What do you mean with incompatible?

I believe that nobody discovered the problem during 14 months is because no 
software I am aware of depends on the missing date string.

How did you get aware of the problem?

&gt;<i> I don't know which are the criteria to release new (alpha/beta) versions.
</I>&gt;<i> More users are seeing this issue because cdrtools (mkisofs) 3.01a07 was recently added to Slackware -current, and the next release of Slackware stable seems to be relatively close. Also Debian is preparing its next stable release. As known, these 2 Linux distros are the based to many others.
</I>
I thought Debian is still OSS hostile and does not ship mkisofs...... Did this 
change?

&gt;<i> Additionally, since the resulting ISO images (of mkisofs 3.01a05, -a06 and -a07 too) are incompatible to ECMA-119, some (few) tools will not accept (work) with those ISO images. One such software is 7-zip, which is in time also used by many other tools to expand ISO images (like for example multiboot USB-media related utilities).
</I>&gt;<i> So, as I was saying, I don't know which criteria you use to release (or not) new alpha versions. Please consider releasing a bug-fix release, so the developers of relevant Linux distros would be able to update cdrtools too before their mayor next releases.
</I>
The software was tested against known problems, things like this may rarely 
happen.
