Excellent, that clears up the defect management problem then. The reason
why I'm testing cdrecord etc direct is because:

1. k3b reported all BD burns as failed due to write I/O error right at
the end, yet no errors were reported in the log.
2. It had no idea what the size of the disc was - literally files
written that CRC'd to 0000... in the first burn.
3. The slow write issue due to unwanted defect management.

So, now I have a few partial and full BD-R burns under my belt courtesy
f cdrecord, I can see that if I never did this research project burning
blurays would remain a mess. Please can you mail me an email address I
can Paypal to? Since basically you 'implemented' stopping defect
management already ;)

OK, so the 2x issue probably means that the drive is ignoring the order
to burn at a higher speed, even though it purports to support
forcespeed. Shame - perhaps this is due to the media being LTH.

I have started to look into getting the drive's firmware out of it to
find whatever this media table is, but the special Liteon tools are all
Windows-based and dont work in WINE (Debian Testing) :/

One thing that I havent found yet with cdrecord is a verification mode -
with Nero back in the Windows days and now k3b, I always have it verify
what it burnt immediately after the burn, since the burning tool is the
only thing that actually knows what has been burnt (i.e. confirming the
contents of the sectors that have been burnt, rather than hashing files
in a filesytem which I can do). If it isn't there, is this beyond the
scope of cdrecord currently?

Thanks
