<PRE>Dear list,

This is my very first post to this list and seeking some solution which
I can't solve myself yet; after trying since last one week.
I am a linux user and using cdrtools from its original source
<A HREF="http://cdrecord.berlios.de/old/private/cdrecord.html.">http://cdrecord.berlios.de/old/private/cdrecord.html.</A>
There are a lot of GUI tools like K3B, XCDroast etc.... etc.... which
are quite enough to do CD/DVD burning.
BUT I am still looking for a simple CLI tool which is simply based on
cdrtools and give nice dialog based interface so
that a newbie can handle CD/DVD burning very easily.

I have seen some perl based script and shell script to do this but those
don't fulfill my objective.
Hence I am developing a CLI based Cd/DVD  burner using  simple  dialog
as well as whiptail command
available in linux. I am in the middle of my development. But I stuck
with some problem and fighting to solve it.
hence I request your help.

1&gt; How can I check with cdrecord/cdrtools that the drive is empty ?
2&gt; How can I check the CD-R (with some data in it) support mutisession
or not ?
3&gt; What is the difference between a Diskcopy than Cloning ? and what is
the best method of cloning i.e by cdrecord or by cdread ?

Kindly help me to solve this so that I can proceed in my programming.
thanks to you all.
