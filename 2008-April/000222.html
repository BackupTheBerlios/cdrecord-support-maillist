You are not telling lies. I did the requested tests, as anyone (if 
there is anyone) reading this list will see.

You suggested your OpenSolaris LiveCD. I already replied that it can 
not even see the SATA DVD burner. But you ignored that FACT.

You suggested cdrecord in Windows. I installed Cygwin and cdrecord 
failed under it. But you ignored that FACT.

I reported to you that we tried to compile the latest cdrecord on 
Cygwin, but it failed, because &quot;it refuses to build, stupid Schily 
make program wants MS Visual C to compile it instead of gcc.&quot; That 
was reported by a programmer and OSS expert with IBM who tried to 
compile cdrecord under Cygwin. But you ignored that FACT.

It is not customary for a maintainer to suggest someone install 
another OS to run the app he has written for a primary OS. But then, 
you seem absurd beyond belief. Just say, &quot;I, Jorg Schilling, cannot 
support cdrecord running under Linux. Because a couple of years ago 
when I refused to comply with the Linux kernel guidelines, the Linux 
kernel people were forced to patch my app to make it work. Since 
then, I abandoned my app under Linux.&quot;

I did the requests ... you apparently have no clue about the error 
messages that cdrecord outputs. You have not once addressed or 
interpreted them. I assume you can not.

You have been accused by Res, and I want to know your defense. He 
said, and I quote, &quot;you are not infact subscribed to cdrecord list, 
you are stealthly subscribed to joergs personal anti-linux/pro 
solaris rhetoric list.&quot;

Is this true?

Are you going to deny or admit this as true?
