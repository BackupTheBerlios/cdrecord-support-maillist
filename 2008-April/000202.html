Sorry for the mistake.

&gt;<i> Did you ever try to write in RAW mode as cdrecord suggests?
</I>
Yes. Recording in RAW mode was included in the previous message.

&gt;<i> Your problem is not a problem caused by media 
</I>
But later you say:
&quot;BTW: you are using low quality media, did you try better media?&quot;
and still later you say:
&quot;This is obviously a problem with the medium...&quot;

Why do you say &quot;you are using low quality media&quot;?

The CD-RW media is Memorex which I bought in the States. They have
all been good.

I used 2 different types of CD-R media. One is labeled TDK and the
other Verbatim. The TDK (used in the first message to this list)
burned 48 good out of a spindle of 50 (to several different PATA DVD
burners) in Linux, Winodws, and with my DVD duplicator. The only
coasters were made using cdrecord to write to the SATA burner.

The Verbatim are giving the same results.

Please educate me as to how you know they are low quality, and what 
is not 'low quality', and how would one determine the quality 
before/after buying the media?

NB: We live in the People's Republic of China. They are experts at 
copying everything, so labeling is not necessarily true. We purchase 
from people we've used for over 5 years, which is the best 
reliability standard we know atm.

The only bad burns have come from the SATA Asus DRW-2014L1T using 
cdrecord in Linux, to every different type of media used.

I have included burn results later in this message to the SATA DVD
drive and the PATA DVD drive using the _exact_same_disc_ so that you
can see the problem is _not_ bad media.

&gt;<i> Later, you write that you have SATA, what is correct?
</I>
First, check the title of the message ^^^.

Clearly the &quot;cdrecord -scanbus&quot; output from Linux in each message
would indicate that this machine has one SATA DVD burner, and one
PATA DVD burner. Only the Solaris LiveCD failed to detect the SATA
drives.

&gt;<i> Does cdrecord write DVDs with your drive?
</I>&gt;<i> Why did you use growisofs?
</I>
Because I am in the habit of writing DVDs with growisofs for 5
years. Is there something wrong with using growisofs?

&gt;<i> If you like to remove the medium, you cannot boot the &quot;full&quot; version,
</I>&gt;<i> you need to boot the version that needs most RAM space as this is completely 
</I>&gt;<i> inside memory.
</I>
It is not necessary to use the RAM option and remove the medium. The 
computer was booted with the DVD in the PATA DVD drive. The SATA DVD 
drive is the one we are testing, which was not detected by the 
Solaris LiveCD.

I first used the &quot;full&quot; version. I also tried the &quot;amd64&quot; version.
None of them detected my SATA DVD burner. SchilliX-0.6.6 also does 
not contain the latest version of cdrecord.

&gt;<i> Well, some hardware does not correctly implement the SATA layer (I believe it 
</I>&gt;<i> is called ehci)
</I>
The Enhanced Host Controller Interface (EHCI) is standard for USB
2.0 &quot;high speed&quot; (480 Mbit/sec, 60 Mbyte/sec) host controller
hardware. It has nothing to do with Serial-ATA (SATA).

&gt;<i> and for this reason, Solaris does not yet support ATAPI over
</I>&gt;<i> SATA for those chips. You need to tell the BIOS to emulate PATA for the SATA
</I>&gt;<i> interfaces. The fact that Solaris does not yet support ATAPI over your SATA
</I>&gt;<i> interface could be a hint for a Linux kernel bug....
</I>
There is no setting in this BIOS to &quot;emulate PATA for the SATA
interface.&quot; Check it out:
<A HREF="http://dlsvr04.asus.com/pub/ASUS/mb/sock754/k8v-x/e1879_k8v-x.pdf">http://dlsvr04.asus.com/pub/ASUS/mb/sock754/k8v-x/e1879_k8v-x.pdf</A>

&gt;<i> Then it did return to a prompt but you did not see it....
</I>
No, as I wrote, it returned to a prompt _after_ I pressed &quot;Enter&quot;.

&gt;<i> If your SATA interface chip supports ATAPI in Solaris _and_ if your SATA 
</I>&gt;<i> hard disk is supporting tagged command queing, it will be shown up in Solaris.
</I>&gt;<i> It may be that Linux implements SCSI emulation for the HD drive....
</I>
This output shows which driver the Linux kernel uses for that 
controller:

&gt;<i> As I told above, Solaris does not emulate SCSI, you need hard disks that
</I>&gt;<i> speak SCSI and you need a SATA interface that has a driver with native ATAPI 
</I>&gt;<i> support. If Solaris does not support ATAPI in native mode, this is a hint that 
</I>&gt;<i> the Linux driver may have problems with your HW. I have a PATA computer at home 
</I>&gt;<i> that gives similar problems (Illegal field in CDB although the SCSI command is 
</I>&gt;<i> 100% correct) with Linux but everything works fine if the same hardware and same
</I>&gt;<i> cdrecord version is running on Solaris or SCO unix.
</I>
The Linux kernel has no problem with my SATA hard disk, or with my 
PATA DVD burner, or detecting and assigning the sata_via (libata) 
driver to the SATA DVD burner.

Could you please point me to the location to produce some evidence 
that this is a problem with the Linux kernel?

If you can do this, I can send a bug report to Jeff Garzik. But as 
it stands, the Linux kernel detects the SATA DVD burner, and 
cdrecord will not write to it without producing errors. Which is why 
I first wrote the cdrecord-support list.

Please, I'm a newb looking for help. It does not matter to me where 
the problem lies, only that it can be fixed.

&gt;<i> The Linux kernel most likely bastardizes the send cue sheet command before 
</I>&gt;<i> forwarding it to the drive. This is why I like to see the same test on Solaris.
</I>&gt;<i> Please switch your BIOS into PATA emulation mode and again boot Solaris in ram 
</I>&gt;<i> only mode.
</I>
What do you mean by &quot;the Linux kernel most likely bastardizes the 
send cue sheet command before forwarding it to the drive&quot;? This is 
beyond my knowledge level, so I don't understand it.

Solaris cannot detect the SATA DVD burner, so it is impossible to 
test it. And there is no &quot;PATA emulation mode&quot; in my BIOS.

&gt;<i> Does it work using cdrecord on Windows? This is another hint that your problem 
</I>&gt;<i> is a bad drive rin the Linux kernel.
</I>
After two days of trying to download and install Cygwin, I gave up. 
I used many different mirrors. Every time it would download for a 
while, then stop and I'd have to start over. Maybe if I knew which 
software where required to download for Cygwin to use cdrecord. 
Maybe it would be less and I could get it all before it failed. 
However, I have found no such information.

The SATA DVD burner works in Windows burning with Nero.

&gt;<i> If this is a coaster, then your drive is broken or Linux again did 
</I>&gt;<i> do bad things while cdrecord was writing.....
</I>
The drive is not broken. It works fine in Windows using Nero. It
_reads_ CD/VCD/DVD pre-recorded discs fine in Linux. It just doesn't
write using cdrecord without errors.

So how come Linux does not do bad things while writing to the PATA
DVD burner?

You have given me no proof that this problem is related to the Linux
kernel. If you can produce such proof, I will send that in an email
to Jeff Garzik, the maintainer of libata. If you read my previous
email, you will see that sata_via (from libata) is the driver the
Linux kernel is using for the controller which the SATA DVD burner,
and SATA hard drive, are attached to. There are _no_errors_ produced
for the SATA hard disk.

&gt;<i> BTW: you are using low quality media, did you try better media?
</I>
&gt;<i> This is obviously a problem with the medium...
</I>
Okay, here's evidence that &quot;the medium&quot; is not at fault:

First, burning to a Memorex CD-RW in the SATA Asus DRW-2014L1T:
