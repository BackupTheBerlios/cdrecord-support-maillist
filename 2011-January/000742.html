</I>

The next thing I would try is to omit (or use a different) dev=
and driveropts= options and see if the problem goes away under
cdrecord. IIRC, growisofs enables burnfree all the time while
cdrecord gives you a choice and turns it off by default. Most
machines are more than fast enough to keep the buffer full all
the time, so it is probably better to keep it off. If you can
affect the problem with options, that would help narrow it down.

You can also try out the latest vanilla Linux kernel

<A HREF="http://www.kernel.org/">http://www.kernel.org/</A>

and see if that affects it. Depending on the person and the
system, trying out a new kernel can range from being easy to
a royal pain.

Anyway, that's how I normally investigate these types of problems.
Sometime ago I was bitten by a bad drive and it is all too easy
to blame software. So the first thing I do now do is try another
application if possible to rule that out first and it sometimes
saves a lot of time. DVD writers are getting less flaky than they
used to be. It took 'em long enough to get it right IMHO.

FWIW, I've had good experience with the NEC/Optiarc drives
especially since there is a linux flasher and modified firmware
tools for them:

<A HREF="http://liggydee.cdfreaks.com/page/en/">http://liggydee.cdfreaks.com/page/en/</A>

I've never had any problem with them under Linux, cdrecord, etc.,
and they are proving to be durable and reliable. I hope this
remains true after Sony got into the act with the new Optiarc line.
I've also heard good things about LG and Samsung's drives.


  Cheers,

  Mike
