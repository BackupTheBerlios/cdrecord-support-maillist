I know where you're coming from here, but machines these days don't
even have floppies anymore. Another option would be to boot to a
USB drive. I laughed when I first heard of this (What next?! Boot
to the parallel port? Boot to the monitor? Boot to the sound card? LOL!),
but I can see good uses such as rescue drives, etc.

FWIW, for those of you in the market for a SD card USB reader as opposed
to a USB flash drive that cannot be upgraded, you might as well get the
newer SDXC ones that can handle at least 64GB SD cards. Some of these
readers are going for as little as four bucks on Ebay:

<A HREF="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=260702383137">http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=260702383137</A>


Anyway, are there any problems with SATA drives and FreeDOS? Any Microsoft
OS boot disks aren't going to have SATA support prior to Win2000. If the
computer is using the motherboard SATA hardware, the BIOS should support
that, but I don't know if there are any other potential issues here with
a modern BIOS SATA API presented to an older OS (e.g., 200GB+ drives).

I've never used Wine yet myself, but it is an interesting option.
Looking at the FAQ:

<A HREF="http://wiki.winehq.org/FAQ">http://wiki.winehq.org/FAQ</A>

It does NOT require Windows. It is an independent Unix reimplementation
of the Windows API! It is is a set of Unix libraries that map Windows
system calls to those of the Unix host system. So, a Windows binary will
think it is running under Windows when in fact it is actually calling a
Unix library that maps the calls to the kernel and X. The wine source
tar ball download is only about 11MB, so if the setup is not too much,
it might be fun to try:

<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/wine/files/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/wine/files/</A>

For those of you that know how to configure PATH, /etc/ld.so.conf and
/etc/man.conf could install the whole thing in /opt/wine, add the
/opt/wine/bin, /opt/wine/lib and /opt/win/man paths and try it out. If
you don't like it, tis easy enough to yank out without touching the
rest of the system. Note cdrtools likes to use a similar approach with
/opt/schily.

Beware that any Windows malware running under wine can touch the Unix
filesystem. For this reason, run only trusted applications, do not run
wine as root, and perhaps use a different user account. However, you
might have to run under root for a flasher utility. Anyway, although
Windows malware might be able to alter or delete files, it probably
would not be able to &quot;infect&quot; the Unix system because the files it
would have to target would be totally different from Windows.

I'm almost totally free of Windows except for one or two applications.
One of these is stuff like firmware flashers and another is tax software.

Here in the USA, tax time is coming up again and I think I might try to
see if Wine will run Taxact:

<A HREF="http://www.taxact.com/">http://www.taxact.com/</A>

If so, I really would be totally free of the awful MS windows. I'd love it
if GNU came out with some tax software. Even better would tax reform that
would get rid of the ludicrous and embarrassing complexity of our
income tax system ... but I digress.


  Cheers,

  Mike
