<PRE>Hi J&#246;rg, thanks for your quick reply!

&gt;<i> &gt; readcd dev=5,0,0 -clone f=readcd.img
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; cdrecord dev=5,0,0 -raw96r -clone -v readcd.img
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is to copy CDs with unknown format and to copy CDs that try to prevent 
</I>&gt;<i> copying by introducing specific defects.
</I>
This play protected non-CDDA discs are a bad thing. But I own a few and
would backup them too. Just tried cdda2wav for one of them, and it
worked fine (except cdda2wav complaining about atom, edge and drop
issues some times). So I guess readcd -clone is not always required,
even in such a case. Only noticeable thing is that cdda2wav produces an
16th empty .wav track of 35MB, while on the original there are only 15
tracks and one data track (it is a CD-extra). May the 16th track be the
data?

&gt;<i> This copy mode does not repair any defect and thus is a bad idea for copying audio data.
</I>
But in case of good original audio cd without any errors, clone mode
should copy them, right? My test results are somewhat unexpected then.

&gt;<i> &gt; But even after about 20 trials I could not manage to create only one CD that plays in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; all players here.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Without information on why this happened, I cannot help.
</I>
I will provide you with any debug information I can retrieve, starting
with command line output below. What else is of use?

&gt;<i> For CD-extra, extract the second data session separately with readcd and
</I>&gt;<i> append a session with this data.
</I>
Sounds good. So I just need a way to automatically determine whether it
is CD-extra and do the additional stuff, but I can figure this out I
think. There are lots of CDs, and examining each single one by hand
would catch me in front of PC all night long. Being there at work the
whole day is enough:-)

What about the gapless issue? Might cdrecord -dao be useful?

&gt;<i> Did you replace the broken fork that comes with Ubuntu by the original software?
</I>
Sure. Compiled cdrtools 3.00. I don't know the fork well enough, so I'm
not going to comment the stated brokenness:)

Best,
Tobias
