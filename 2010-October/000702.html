<PRE>Hi!

While trying to back up my music CD collection to hard disk using
cdrtools, i encountered several questions and problems which I think is
worth asking here, as I couldn't find answers on the net despite
extensive search.

I'd like to create as close as possible 1:1 backups of my audio CDs,
meaning:
1) Backup in a lossless audio format, .wav or whatever
2) Preserve all meta data of the original CD
3) No gaps in original shall result in no gaps in backup
4) If the original CD was some CD Extra, backup both audio and data
5) Error correction if possible (but of less importance for me, as most
originals are in quite good condition)
would be nice: 6) do all this stuff as automated as possible, maybe
shell script

I saw that k3b has &quot;Clone Copy&quot; mode, which sounded just like what I
want and it uses readcd -clone for this (well, it uses the forked tools,
but I now use cdrtools 3.00). So, at command line I started with:
readcd dev=5,0,0 -clone f=readcd.img
cdrecord dev=5,0,0 -raw96r -clone -v readcd.img

Read and write process went fine, but the resulting CD sadly was not
playable in all CD Players (e.g. my old Technics standalone player liked
it, while my car radio reported CD ERROR for the same CD). I tried
several combinations of source CDs, blank CD-Rs, and two CD writers
(TSSTcorp CDDVDW SH-S223C and HL-DT-ST DVDRAM GSA-4081B). But even after
about 20 trials I could not manage to create only one CD that plays in
all players here.

I found this
<A HREF="http://www.mail-archive.com/gentoo-user@lists.gentoo.org/msg86945.html">http://www.mail-archive.com/gentoo-user@lists.gentoo.org/msg86945.html</A>
discussion, which seems to be related to my problem. One statement there
is:
&quot;The clone copy mode of cdrecord is definitely worse for audio CDs than
using cdda2wav -vall cddb=0 -paranoia and writing using cdrecord.&quot;

Could you please clarify this? Is it true, and if so, why is clone mode
bad for audio CDs?

Is my issue described above known or confirmed to be a general problem?
Is there any solution or workaround?

I would be happy if I can realize my intention somehow else. For example
with cdda2wav -vall cddb=0 -paranoia as suggested in above discussion.
But I'm not sure whether all points of my &quot;what I want to do&quot; list can
be done this way. Could you explain if and how 3) and 4) are possible?

Cheers,
Tobias

Btw: Ubuntu 10.04, Linux 2.6.31-11-rt, x86-64 here
